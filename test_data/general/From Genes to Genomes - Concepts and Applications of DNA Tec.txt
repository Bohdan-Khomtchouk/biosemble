1 Introduction
This book is about the study and manipulation of nucleic acids, and how this
can be used to answer biological questions. Although we hear a lot about the
commercial applications, in particular (at the moment) the genetic modification of plants, the real revolution lies in the incredible advances in our understanding of how cells work. Until about 30 years ago, genetics was a patient
and laborious process of selecting variants (whether of viruses, bacteria, plants
or animals), and designing breeding experiments that would provide data on
how the genes concerned were inherited. The study of human genetics proceeded even more slowly, because of course you could only study the consequences of what happened naturally. Then, in the 1970s, techniques were
discovered that enabled us to cut DNA precisely into specific fragments, and
join them together again in different combinations. For the first time it was
possible to isolate and study specific genes. Since this applied equally to
human genes, the impact on human genetics was particularly marked. In
parallel with this, hybridization techniques were developed that enabled the
identification of specific DNA sequences, and (somewhat later) methods were
introduced for determining the sequence of these bits of DNA. Combining
those advances with automated techniques and the concurrent advance in
computer power has led to the determination of the full sequence of the
human genome.
This revolution does not end with understanding how genes work and how
the information is inherited. Genetics, and especially modern molecular genetics, underpins all the biological sciences. By studying, and manipulating,
specific genes, we develop our understanding of the way in which the products
of those genes interact to give rise to the properties of the organism itself. This
could range from, for example, the mechanism of motility in bacteria to the
causes of human genetic diseases and the processes that cause a cell to grow
uncontrollably giving rise to a tumour. In many cases, we can identify precisely
the cause of a specific property. We can say that a change in one single base in
the genome of a bacterium will make it resistant to a certain antibiotic, or that a
change in one base in human DNA could cause debilitating disease. This only
scratches the surface of the power of these techniques, and indeed this book can
only provide an introduction to them. Nevertheless, we hope that by the time

2

INTRODUCTION

you have studied it, you will have some appreciation of what can be (and
indeed has been) achieved.
Genetic manipulation is traditionally divided into in vitro and in vivo work.
Traditionally, investigators will first work in vitro, using enzymes derived from
various organisms to create a recombinant DNA molecule in which the DNA
they want to study is joined to a vector. This recombinant vector molecule is
then processed in vivo inside a host organism, more often than not a strain of the
Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacterium. A clone of the host carrying the foreign
DNA is grown, producing a great many identical copies of the DNA, and
sometimes its products as well. Today, in many cases the in vivo stage is
bypassed altogether by the use of PCR (polymerase chain reaction), a method
which allows us to produce many copies of our DNA in vitro without the help
of a host organism.
In the early days, E. coli strains carrying recombinant DNA molecules were
treated with extreme caution. E. coli is a bacterium which lives in its billions
within our digestive system, and those of other mammals, and which will
survive quite easily in our environment, for instance in our food and on our
beaches. So there was a lot of concern that the introduction of foreign DNA
into E. coli would generate bacteria with dangerous properties. Fortunately,
this is one fear that has been shown to be unfounded. Some natural E. coli
strains are pathogenic ± in particular the O157:H7 strain which can cause
severe disease or death. By contrast, the strains used for genetic manipulation
are harmless disabled laboratory strains that will not even survive in the gut.
Working with genetically modified E. coli can therefore be done very safely
(although work with any bacterium has to follow some basic safety rules).
However, the most commonly used type of vector, plasmids, are shared readily
between bacteria; the transmission of plasmids between bacteria is behind
much of the natural spread of antibiotic resistance. What if our recombinant
plasmids were transmitted to other bacterial strains that do survive on their
own? This, too, has turned out not to be a worry in the majority of cases. The
plasmids themselves have been manipulated so that they cannot be readily
transferred to other bacteria. Furthermore, carrying a gene such as that coding
for, say, dogfish insulin, or an artificial chromosome carrying 100 000 bases of
human genomic DNA is a great burden to an E. coli cell, and carries no reward
whatsoever. In fact, in order to make them accept it, we have to create conditions that will kill all bacterial cells not carrying the foreign gene. If you fail to
do so when you start your culture in the evening, you can be sure that your
bacteria will have dropped the foreign gene the next morning. Evolution in
progress!
Whilst nobody today worries about genetically modified E. coli, and indeed
diabetics have been injecting genetically modified insulin produced by E. coli
for decades, the issue of genetic engineering is back on the public agenda, this
time pertaining to higher organisms. It is important to distinguish the genetic

INTRODUCTION

modification of plants and animals from cloning plants and animals. The latter
simply involves the production of genetically identical individuals; it does not
involve any genetic modification whatsoever. (The two technologies can be
used in tandem, but that is another matter.) So, we will ignore the cloning of
higher organisms here. Although it is conceptually very similar to producing a
clone of a genetically modified E. coli, it is really a matter of reproductive cell
biology, and frankly relatively uninteresting from the molecular point of view.
By contrast, the genetic modification of higher organisms is both conceptually
similar to the genetic modification of bacteria, and also very pertinent as it is a
potential and, in principle, fairly easy application following the isolation and
analysis of a gene.
At the time of writing, the ethical and environmental consequences of this
application are still a matter of vivid debate and media attention, and it would
be very surprising if this is not still continuing by the time you read this. Just as
in the laboratory, the genetic modification as such is not necessarily the biggest
risk here. Thus, if a food crop carries a gene that makes it tolerant of herbicides
(weedkillers), it would seem reasonable to worry more about increased levels of
herbicides in our food than about the genetic modification itself. Equally, the
worry about such an organism escaping into the wild may turn out to be
exaggerated. Just as, without an evolutionary pressure to keep the genetic
modification, our E. coli in the example above died out overnight, it appears
quite unlikely that a plant that wastes valuable resources on producing a
protein that protects it against herbicides will survive long in the wild in the
absence of herbicide use.
Nonetheless, this issue is by no means as clear-cut as that of genetically
modified bacteria. We cannot test these organisms in a contained laboratory.
They take months or a year to produce each generation, not 20 minutes as
E. coli does. And even if they should be harmless in themselves, there are other
issues as well, such as the one exemplified above. Thus, this is an important and
complicated issue, and to understand it fully you need to know about evolution, ecology, food chemistry, nutrition, and molecular biology. We hope that
reading this book will be of some help for the last of these. We also hope that it
will convey some of the wonder, excitement, and intellectual stimulation that
this science brings to its practitioners. What better way to reverse the boredom
of a long journey than to indulge in the immense satisfaction of constructing a
clever new screening algorithm? Who needs jigsaw and crossword puzzles when
you can figure out a clever way of joining two DNA fragments together? And
how can you ever lose the fascination you feel about the fact that the drop of
enzyme that you're adding to your test tube is about to manipulate the DNA
molecules in it with surgical precision?

2 Basic Molecular Biology
In this book, we assume you already have a working knowledge of the basic
concepts of molecular biology. This chapter serves as a reminder of the key
aspects of molecular biology that are especially relevant to this book.

2.1 Nucleic Acid Structure
2.1.1 The DNA backbone
Manipulation of nucleic acids in the laboratory is based on their physical and
chemical properties, which in turn are reflected in their biological function.
Intrinsically, DNA is a very stable molecule. Scientists routinely send DNA
samples in the post without worrying about refrigeration. Indeed, DNA of high
enough quality to be cloned has been recovered from frozen mammoths and
mummified Pharaohs thousands of years old. This stability is provided by the
robust repetitive phosphate±sugar backbone in each DNA strand, in which the
phosphate links the 5H position of one sugar to the 3H position of the next
(Figure 2.1). The bonds between these phosphorus, oxygen, and carbon atoms
are all covalent bonds. Controlled degradation of DNA requires enzymes
(nucleases) that break these covalent bonds. These are divided into endonucleases, which attack internal sites in a DNA strand, and exonucleases, which
nibble away at the ends. We can for the moment ignore other enzymes that
attack for example the bonds linking the bases to the sugar residues. Some of
these enzymes are non-specific, and lead to a generalized destruction of DNA.
It was the discovery of restriction endonucleases (or restriction enzymes), which
cut DNA strands at specific positions, that opened up the possibility of
recombinant DNA technology (`genetic engineering'), coupled with DNA ligases,
which can join two double-stranded DNA molecules together.
RNA molecules, which contain the sugar ribose (Figure 2.2), rather than the
deoxyribose found in DNA, are less stable than DNA. This is partly due to
their greater susceptibility to attack by nucleases (ribonucleases), but they are
also more susceptible to chemical degradation, especially by alkaline conditions.

NUCLEIC ACID STRUCTURE

2.1.2 The base pairs
In addition to the sugar (2H deoxyribose) and phosphate, DNA molecules
contain four nitrogen-containing bases (Figure 2.3): two pyrimidines, thymine
(T) and cytosine (C), and two purines, guanine (G) and adenine (A). (Other
bases can be incorporated into synthetic DNA in the laboratory, and sometimes other bases occur naturally.) Since the purines are bigger than the
pyrimidines, a regular double helix requires a purine in one strand to be
matched by a pyrimidine in the other. Furthermore, the regularity of the
double helix requires specific hydrogen bonding between the bases so that
they fit together, with an A opposite a T, and a G opposite a C (Figure 2.4).
We refer to these pairs of bases as complementary, and hence to one strand as
the complement of the other. Note that the two DNA strands run in opposite
directions. In a conventional representation of a double-stranded sequence
the `top' strand has a 5H hydroxyl group at the left-hand end (and is said to
be written in the 5H to 3H direction), while the `bottom' strand has its 5H end at the
right-hand end. Since the two strands are complementary, there is no information in the second strand that cannot be deduced from the first one.
Therefore, to save space, it is common to represent a double-stranded DNA
sequence by showing the sequence of only one strand. When only one strand is

Complementary sequences

DNA sequences are often represented as the sequence of just one of the two strands,
in the 5H to 3H direction, reading from left to right. Thus the double-stranded DNA
sequence
5H -AGGCTG-3H
3H -TCCGAC-5H
would be shown as AGGCTG, with the orientation (i.e., the position of the 5H and 3H
ends) being inferred.
To get the sequence of the other (complementary) strand, you must not only
change the A and G residues to T and C (and vice versa), but you must also reverse
the order.
So in this example, the complement of AGGCTG is CAGCCT, reading the lower
strand from right to left (again in the 5H to 3H direction).

shown, we use the 5H to 3H direction; the sequence of the second strand is
inferred from that, and you have to remember that the second strand runs in
the opposite direction. Thus a single strand sequence written as AGGCTG (or
more fully 5H AGGCTG3H ) would have as its complement CAGCCT
(5H CAGCCT3H ) (see Box 2.1).

NUCLEIC ACID STRUCTURE

Thanks to this base-pairing arrangement, the two strands can be safely
separated ± both in the cell and in the test tube ± under conditions which
disrupt the hydrogen bonds between the bases but are much too mild to pose
any threat to the covalent bonds in the backbone. This is referred to as
denaturation of DNA and, unlike the denaturation of many proteins, it is
reversible. Because of the complementarity of the base pairs, the strands will
easily join together again and renature. In the test tube, DNA is readily
denatured by heating, and the denaturation process is therefore often referred
to as melting even when it is accomplished by means other than heat (e.g. by
NaOH). Denaturation of a double-stranded DNA molecule occurs over a
short temperature range, and the midpoint of that range is defined as the
melting temperature (Tm ). This is influenced by the base composition of the
DNA. Since guanine:cytosine (GC) base pairs have three hydrogen bonds, they
are stronger (i.e. melt less easily) than adenine:thymine (AT) pairs, which have
only two hydrogen bonds. It is therefore possible to estimate the melting
temperature of a DNA fragment if you know the sequence (or the base
composition and length). These considerations are important in understanding
the technique known as hybridization, in which gene probes are used to detect
specific nucleic acid sequences. We will look at hybridization in more detail in
Chapter 8.
Although the normal base pairs (A±T and G±C) are the only forms that are
fully compatible with the Watson±Crick double helix, pairing of other bases
can occur, especially in situations where a regular double helix is less important
(such as the folding of single-stranded nucleic acids into secondary structures ±
see below).
In addition to the hydrogen bonds, the double stranded DNA structure is
maintained by hydrophobic interactions between the bases. The hydrophobic
nature of the bases means that a single-stranded structure, in which the bases
are exposed to the aqueous environment, is unstable. Pairing of the bases
enables them to be removed from interaction with the surrounding water. In
contrast to the hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions are relatively nonspecific. Thus, nucleic acid strands will tend to stick together even in the
absence of specific base-pairing, although the specific interactions make the
association stronger. The specificity of the interaction can therefore be increased by the use of chemicals (such as formamide) that reduce the hydrophobic interactions.
What happens if there is only a single nucleic acid strand? This is normally
the case with RNA, but single-stranded forms of DNA also exist. For
example, in some viruses the genetic material is single-stranded DNA. A
single-stranded nucleic acid molecule will tend to fold up on itself to form
localized double-stranded regions, including structures referred to as hairpins
or stem-loop structures. This has the effect of removing the bases from the
surrounding water. At room temperature, in the absence of denaturing agents,

10

BASIC MOLECULAR BIOLOGY

a single-stranded nucleic acid will normally consist of a complex set of such
localized secondary structure elements, which is especially evident with RNA
molecules such as transfer RNA (tRNA) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA). This
can also happen to a limited extent with double stranded DNA, where short
sequences can tend to loop out of the regular double helix. Since this makes it
easier for enzymes to unwind the DNA, and to separate the strands, these
sequences can play a role in the regulation of gene expression, and in the
initiation of DNA replication.
A further factor to be taken into account is the negative charge on the
phosphate groups in the nucleic acid backbone. This works in the opposite
direction to the hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions; the strong
negative charge on the DNA strands causes electrostatic repulsion that tends
to repel the two strands. In the presence of salt, this effect is counteracted by
the presence of a cloud of counterions surrounding the molecule, neutralizing
the negative charge on the phosphate groups. However, if you reduce the salt
concentration, any weak interactions between the strands will be disrupted by
electrostatic repulsion ± and therefore we can use low salt conditions to
increase the specificity of hybridization (see Chapter 8).

2.1.3 RNA structure
Chemically, RNA is very similar to DNA. The fundamental chemical difference
is that the RNA backbone contains ribose rather than the 2H -deoxyribose (i.e.
ribose without the hydroxyl group at the 2H position) present in DNA (Figure
2.5). However, this slight difference has a powerful effect on some properties of
the nucleic acid, especially on its stability. Thus, RNA is readily destroyed
byexposure to high pH. Under these conditions, DNA is stable: although the
strands will separate, they will remain intact and capable of renaturation when
the pH is lowered again. A further difference between RNA and DNA is that the
former contains uracil rather than thymine (Figure 2.5).
Generally, while most of the DNA we use is double stranded, most of the
RNA we encounter consists of a single polynucleotide strand ± although we
must remember the comments above regarding the folding of single-stranded
nucleic acids. However, this distinction between RNA and DNA is not an
inherent property of the nucleic acids themselves, but is a reflection of the
natural roles of RNA and DNA in the cell, and of the method of production.
In all cellular organisms (i.e. excluding viruses), DNA is the inherited material
responsible for the genetic composition of the cell, and the replication process
that has evolved is based on a double-stranded molecule; the roles of RNA in
the cell do not require a second strand, and indeed the presence of a second,
complementary, strand would preclude its role in protein synthesis. However,
there are some viruses that have double-stranded RNA as their genetic material,

plasmids) replicate via single-stranded DNA forms.

2.1.4 Nucleic acid synthesis
We do not need to consider all the details of how nucleic acids are synthesized.
The basic features that we need to remember are summarized in Figure 2.6,
which shows the addition of a nucleotide to the growing end (3H -OH) of a DNA
strand. The substrate for this reaction is the relevant deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP), i.e. the one that makes the correct base-pair with the corresponding residue on the template strand. The DNA strand is always extended at
the 3H -OH end. For this reaction to occur it is essential that the residue at the
3H -OH end, to which the new nucleotide is to be added, is accurately basepaired with its partner on the other strand.
RNA synthesis occurs in much the same way, as far as this description goes,
except that of course the substrates are nucleotide triphosphates (NTPs) rather
than the deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs). There is one very important
difference though. DNA synthesis only occurs by extension of an existing
strand ± it always needs a primer to get it started. RNA polymerases on the
other hand are capable of starting a new RNA strand from scratch, given the
appropriate signals.

2.1.5 Coiling and supercoiling
DNA can be denatured and renatured, deformed and reformed, and still retain
unaltered function. This is a necessary feature, because as large a molecule as
DNA will need to be packaged if it is to fit within the cell that it controls. The
DNA of a human chromosome, if it were stretched out into an unpackaged
double helix, would be several centimetres long. Thus, cells are dependent on
the packaging of DNA into modified configurations for their very existence.
Double-stranded DNA, in its relaxed state, normally exists as a right-handed
double helix with one complete turn per 10 base pairs; this is known as the B

2.1

NUCLEIC ACID STRUCTURE

13

form of DNA. Hydrophobic interactions between consecutive bases on the
same strand contribute to this winding of the helix, as the bases are brought
closer together enabling a more effective exclusion of water from interaction
with the hydrophobic bases.
There are other forms of double helix that can exist, notably the A form (also
right-handed but more compact, with 11 bases per turn) and Z-DNA which is a
left-handed double helix with a more irregular appearance (a zigzag structure,
hence its designation). The latter is of especial interest as certain regions of
DNA sequence can trigger a localized switch between the right-handed B form
and the left-handed Z form. However, natural DNA resembles most closely the
B form, for most of its length.
However, that is not the complete story. There are higher orders of conformation. The double helix is in turn coiled on itself ± an effect known as supercoiling. There is an interaction between the coiling of the helix and the degree of
supercoiling. As long as the ends are fixed, changing the degree of coiling will
alter the amount of supercoiling, and vice versa. The effect is easily demonstrated (and probably already familiar to you) with a telephone cord. If you
rotate the receiver so as to coil up the cord more tightly and then move the
receiver towards the phone you will not only see the supercoiling of the cord
but also, if you look more closely, you will see that the tightness of the winding
of the cord reduces as it becomes supercoiled.
DNA in vivo is constrained; the ends are not free to rotate. This is most
obviously true of circular DNA structures such as (most) bacterial plasmids.
The net effect of coiling and supercoiling (a property known as the linking
number) is therefore fixed, and cannot be changed without breaking one of the
strands. In nature, there are enzymes known as topoisomerases (including
DNA gyrase) that do just that: they break the DNA strands, and then in effect
rotate the ends and reseal them. This alters the degree of winding of the helix
and thus affects the supercoiling of the DNA. Topoisomerases also have an
ingenious use in the laboratory, which we will consider in Chapter 5.
So the plasmids that we will be referring to frequently in later pages are
naturally supercoiled when they are isolated from the cell. However, if one of
the strands is broken at any point, the DNA is then free to rotate at that point
and can therefore relax into a non-supercoiled form, with the characteristic B
form of the helix. This is known as an open circular form (in contrast to the
covalently closed circular form of the native plasmid). The plasmid will also be
in a relaxed form after insertion of a foreign DNA fragment, or other manipulations. Although we have resealed all the nicks in the DNA, we have not
altered the supercoiling of the molecule; that will not happen until it has been
reinserted into a bacterial cell. Some of the properties of the manipulated
plasmid, such as its transforming ability and its mobility on an agarose gel,
are therefore not the same as those of the native plasmid isolated from a
bacterial cell.

BASIC MOLECULAR BIOLOGY

2.2 Gene Structure and Organization
The definition of a `gene' is rather imprecise. Its origins go back to the early
days of genetics, when it could be used to described the unit of inheritance of
an observable characteristic (a phenotype). As the study of genetics progressed,
it became possible to use the term gene as meaning a DNA sequence coding
for a specific polypeptide, although this ignores those `genes' that code for
RNA molecules such as ribosomal RNA and transfer RNA, which are not
translated into proteins. It also ignores regulatory regions which are necessary
for proper expression of a gene although not themselves transcribed or translated.
We often use the term `gene' as being synonymous with `open reading frame'
(ORF), i.e. the region between the start and stop codons (although even that
definition is still vague as to whether we should or should not include the stop
codon itself). In bacteria, this takes place in an uninterrupted sequence. In
eukaryotes, the presence of introns (see below) makes this definition more
difficult; the region of the chromosome that contains the information for a
specific polypeptide may be many times longer than the actual coding sequence. Basically, it is not possible to produce an entirely satisfactory definition. However, this is rarely a serious problem. We just have to be careful as to
how we use the word depending on whether we are discussing only the coding
region (ORF), the length of sequence that is transcribed into mRNA (including
untranslated regions), or the whole unit in the widest sense (including regulatory elements that are beyond the translation start site).
In this section we want to highlight some of the key differences in `gene'
organization between eukaryotes and prokaryotes (bacteria), as these differences play a major role in the discussion of the application of molecular biology
techniques and their use in different systems.

2.2.1 Operons
In bacteria, it is quite common for a group of genes to be transcribed from a
single promoter into one long RNA molecule; this group of genes is known as
an operon (Figure 2.7). If we are considering protein-coding genes, the transcription product, messenger RNA (mRNA), is then translated into a number
of separate polypeptides. This can occur by the ribosomes reaching the stop
codon at the end of one polypeptide-coding sequence, terminating translation
and releasing the product before re-initiating (without dissociation from the
mRNA). Alternatively, the ribosomes may attach independently to internal
ribosome binding sites within the mRNA sequence. Generally, the genes
involved are responsible for different steps in the same pathway, and this

arrangement facilitates the co-ordinate regulation of those genes, i.e. expression goes up or down together in response to changing conditions.
In eukaryotes, by contrast, the way in which ribosomes initiate translation is
different, which means that they cannot produce separate proteins from a
single mRNA in this way. There are ways in which a single mRNA can give
rise to different proteins, but these work in different ways, such as different
processing of the mRNA (see below) or by producing one long polyprotein or
precursor which is then cleaved into different proteins (as occurs in some
viruses). A few viruses do actually have internal ribosome entry sites.

2.2.2 Exons and introns
In bacteria there is generally a simple one-for-one relationship between the
coding sequence of the DNA, the mRNA and the protein. This is usually not
true for eukaryotic cells, where the initial transcription product is many times
longer than that needed for translation into the final protein. It contains blocks
of sequence (introns) which are removed by processing to generate the final
mRNA for translation (Figure 2.8).
Introns do occur in bacteria, but quite infrequently. This is partly due to the
need for economy in a bacterial cell; the smaller genome and generally more
rapid growth provides an evolutionary pressure to remove unnecessary material from the genome. A further factor arises from the nature of transcription
and translation in a bacterial cell. As the ribosomes are translating the mRNA
while it is being made, there is usually no opportunity for sections of the RNA
to be removed before translation.

2.3 Information Flow: Gene Expression
The way in which genes are expressed is sufficiently central to so much of
the subsequent material in this book that it is worth reviewing briefly the salient
features. The basic dogma (Figure 2.9) is that while DNA is the basic genetic
material that carries information from one generation to the next, its effect
on the characteristics of the cell requires firstly its copying into RNA (transcription), and then the translation of the mRNA into a polypeptide by
ribosomes. Further processes are required before its proper activity can be
manifested: these include the folding of the polypeptide, possibly in association
with other subunits to form a multi-subunit protein, and in some cases modification, e.g. by glycosylation or phosphorylation. It should be noted that in
some cases, RNA rather than protein is the final product of a gene (ribosomal
and transfer RNA molecules for example).

2.3.1 Transcription
Transcription is carried out by RNA polymerase. RNA polymerase recognizes
and binds to a specific sequence (the promoter), and initiates the synthesis of
mRNA from an adjacent position.
A typical bacterial promoter carries two consensus sequences (i.e. sequences
that are closely related in all genes): TTGACA centred at position À35 (i.e. 35
bases before the transcription start site), and TATAAT at À10 (Figure 2.10). It
is important to understand the nature of a consensus: few bacterial promoters

promoters than others ± depending not only on the exact nature of the two
consensus sequences but to a lesser extent on the sequence of a longer region.
The nature and regulation of bacterial promoters, including the existence of
alternative types of promoters, is considered further in Chapter 13.

Box 2.2 Examples of E. coli promoters

Bases matching the ± 10 and 35 consensus sequences are boxed. Spaces are inserted to
optimize the alignment. Note that the consensus is derived from a much larger collection of
characterized promoters.
Position 1 is the transcription start site.

In eukaryotes, by contrast, the promoter is a considerably larger area around
the transcription start site, where a number of trans-acting transcription factors
(i.e. DNA-binding proteins encoded by genes in other parts of the genome) bind
to a number of cis-acting promoter elements (i.e. elements that affect the
expression of the gene next to them) in a considerably more complex scenario.
The need for this added complexity can easily be imagined; if cells carrying the
same genome are differentiated into a multitude of cell types fulfilling very
different functions, a very sophisticated control system is needed to provide
each cell type with its specific repertoire of genes, and to fine-tune the degree of
expression for each one of them. Nonetheless, the promoter region, however
simple or complex, gives rise to different levels of transcription of various genes.
In eukaryotes, the primary transcript, heteronuclear RNA (hnRNA), is very
short-lived as such, as it is processed in a number of steps. A specialized
nucleotide cap is added to the 5H end; this is the site recognized by the ribosomes
in protein synthesis (see below). The precursor mRNA is cleaved at a specific
site towards the 3H end and a poly-A tail, consisting of a long sequence of
adenosine residues, is added to the cut end.. This is a specific process, governed
by polyadenylation recognition sequences in the 3H untranslated region. Nature's `tagging' of mRNA molecules comes in very useful in the laboratory for
the isolation of eukaryotic mRNA (see Chapter 7). Finally, in the process of
splicing, the introns are spliced out and the exons are joined together.
In bacteria, the processes of transcription and translation take place in the
same compartment and simultaneously. In other words, the ribosomes translating the mRNA follow closely behind the RNA polymerase, and polypeptide
production is well under way long before the mRNA is complete. In eukary-

2.3

INFORMATION FLOW: GENE EXPRESSION

19

otes, by contrast, the mature mRNA molecule is transported out of the nucleus
to the cytoplasm where translation takes place.
The resulting level of protein production is dependent on the amount of
the specific mRNA available, rather than just the rate of production. The level
of an mRNA species will be affected by its rate of degradation as well as by
its rate of synthesis. In bacteria, most mRNA molecules are degraded quite
quickly (with a half life of only a few minutes), although some are much
more stable. The instability of the majority of bacterial mRNA molecules
means that bacteria can rapidly alter their profile of gene expression by
changing the transcription of specific genes. The lifespans of most eukaryotic
mRNA molecules are measured in hours rather than minutes. Again, this
is a reflection of the fact that an organism that is able to control its own
environment to a varying extent is subjected to less radical environmental
changes. Consequently, mRNA molecules tend to be more stable in multicellular organisms than in, for example, yeast. Nonetheless, the principle
remains: the level of an mRNA is a function of its production and degradation
rates. We will discuss how to study and disentangle these parameters in
Chapter 13.

2.3.2 Translation
In bacteria, translation starts when ribosomes bind to a specific site (the
ribosome binding site, RBS) which is adjacent to the start codon. The sequence
of the ribosome binding site (also known as the Shine±Dalgarno sequence) has
been recognized as being complementary to the 3H end of the 16S rRNA (Figure
2.11). The precise sequence of this site, and its distance from the start codon
does affect the efficiency of translation, although in nature this is less important than transcriptional efficiency in determining the level of gene expression.
Translation efficiency will also depend on the codon usage, i.e. the match
between synonymous codons and the availability of tRNA that will recognize
each codon. This concept is explored more fully in Chapter 15.

BASIC MOLECULAR BIOLOGY

In bacterial systems, where transcription and translation occur in the same
compartment of the cell, ribosomes will bind to the mRNA as soon as the RBS
has been synthesized. Thus there will be a procession of ribosomes following
close behind the RNA polymerase, translating the mRNA as it is being
produced. So, although the mRNA may be very short-lived, the bacteria are
capable of producing substantial amounts of the corresponding polypeptide.
In eukaryotes, the mechanism (as usual) is much more complicated. Instead
of binding just upstream of the initiation codon, the ribosome binds at the very
5H end of the mRNA to the cap, and reads along the 5H untranslated region
(UTR) until it reaches an initiation codon. The sequence AUG may be encountered on the way without initiation; the surrounding sequence is also important
to define the start of protein synthesis. The fact that the 5H UTR is scanned in its
full length by the ribosome makes it an important region for specifying translation efficiency, and different secondary structures can have either a positive
or a negative effect on the amount of protein that is produced.

3 How to Clone a Gene
3.1 What is Cloning?
Cloning means using asexual reproduction to obtain organisms that are genetically identical to one another, and to the `parent'. Of course, this contrasts
with sexual reproduction, where the offspring are not usually identical. It is
worth stressing that clones are only identical genetically; the actual appearance
and behaviour of the clones will be influenced by other factors such as their
environment. This applies equally to all organisms, from bacteria to humans.
Despite the emotive language that increasingly surrounds the use of the word
`cloning', this is a concept that will be surprisingly familiar to many people. In
particular, anyone with an interest in gardening will know that it is possible to
propagate plants by taking cuttings, and that in this way you will produce a
number of plants that are identical to the parent. These are clones. Similarly,
the routine bacteriological procedure of purifying a bacterial strain by picking
a single colony for inoculating a series of fresh cultures is also a form of
cloning.
The term cloning is also applied to genes, as an extension of the concept. If
you introduce a foreign gene into a bacterium, or any other type of cell, in such
a way that it will be copied when the cell replicates, then you will produce a
large number of cells all with identical copies of that piece of DNA ± you have
cloned the gene (Figure 3.1). By producing a large number of copies in this way,
you can sequence it or label it as a probe to study its expression in the organism
it came from. You can express its protein product in bacterial or eukaryotic
cells. You can mutate it and study what difference that mutation makes to the
properties of the gene, its protein product, or the cell that carries it. You can
even purify the gene from the bacterial clone and inject it into a mouse egg, and
produce a line of transgenic mice that express it. Behind all of these applications lies a cloning process with the same basic steps.
In subsequent chapters, we will consider how this process is achieved,
initially with bacterial cells (mainly E. coli) as the host and later extending
the discussion to alternative host cells. The purpose of this chapter is to present
an overview of the process, with the details of the various steps being considered further in the subsequent chapters.

3.2 Overview of the Procedures
Some bacterial species will naturally take up DNA by a process known as
transformation. However, most species have to be subjected to chemical or
physical treatments before DNA will enter the cells. In all cases, the DNA will
not be replicated by the host cell unless it either recombines with (i.e. is inserted
into) the host chromosome or alternatively is incorporated into a molecule that
is recognized by enzymes within the host cell as a substrate for replication. For
most purposes the latter process is the relevant one. We use vectors to carry the
DNA and allow it to be replicated. There are many types of vectors for use with
bacteria. Some of these vectors are plasmids, which are naturally occurring
pieces of DNA that are replicated independently of the chromosome, and are
inherited by the two daughter cells when the cell divides. (In Chapter 6 we will
encounter other types of vectors, including viruses that infect bacteria; these
are known as bacteriophages, or phages for short.)
The DNA that we want to clone is inserted into a suitable vector, producing
a recombinant molecule consisting of vector plus insert (Figure 3.2). This
recombinant molecule will be replicated by the bacterial cell, so that all the
cells descended from that initial transformant will contain a copy of this piece
of recombinant DNA. A bacterium like E. coli can replicate very rapidly under
laboratory conditions, doubling every 20 minutes or so. This exponential

growth gives rise to very large numbers of cells; after 30 generations (10 hours),
there will be 1 Â 109 (one thousand million, or 1 000 000 000) descendants of
the initial transformant. Each one of these cells carries a copy of the recombinant DNA molecule, so we will have produced a very large number of copies of
the cloned DNA.
Of course exponential growth does not continue indefinitely; after a while,
the bacteria start to run out of nutrients, and stop multiplying. (The reasons for
growth stopping are actually rather more complex than that, but depletion of
nutrients, including diffusion of oxygen, is the main factor.) With E. coli, this
commonly occurs with about 1 Â 109 bacteria per ml of culture. However, if we
take a small sample and add it to fresh medium, exponential growth will
resume. The clone can thus be propagated, and in this way we can effectively
produce unlimited quantities of the cloned DNA. If we can get the bacteria to

24

HOW TO CLONE A GENE

express the cloned gene, we can also get very large amounts of the product of
that gene.
In order to carry out this procedure, we require a method for joining pieces
of DNA to such a vector, as well as a way of cutting the vector to provide an
opportunity for this joining to take place. The key to the development of gene
cloning technology was the discovery of enzymes that would carry out these
reactions in a very precise way. The main enzymes needed are restriction
endonucleases which break the sugar±phosphate backbone of DNA molecules
at precise sites, and DNA ligases which are able to join together the fragments
of DNA that are generated in this way (Figure 3.3). These enzymes, and the
ways in which they are used, are described in more detail in Chapter 5.
Once a piece of DNA has been inserted into a plasmid (forming a recombinant plasmid) it then has to be introduced into the bacterial host by a transformation process. Generally this process is not very efficient so only a small
proportion of bacterial cells actually take up the plasmid. However, by using a
plasmid vector that carries a gene coding for resistance to a specific antibiotic,
we can simply plate out the transformed bacterial culture onto agar plates

containing that antibiotic, and only the cells which have received the plasmid
will be able to grow and form colonies.
This description does not consider how we get hold of a piece of DNA
carrying the specific gene that we want to clone. Even a small and relatively
simple organism like a bacterium contains thousands of genes, and they are not
arranged as discrete packets but are regions of a continuous DNA molecule.
We have to break this molecule into smaller fragments, which we can do
specifically (using restriction endonucleases) or non-specifically (by mechanical
shearing). But however we do it, we will obtain a very large number of different
fragments of DNA with no easy way of reliably purifying a specific fragment,
let alone isolating the specific fragment that carries the required gene. The only
way of separating the fragments is by size, but there are so many fragments that
there will be a lot of different pieces of DNA that are so similar in size that they
cannot be separated.

3.3 Gene Libraries
Fortunately it is not necessary to try to purify specific DNA fragments. One of
the strengths of gene cloning is that it provides another, more powerful, way of
finding a specific piece of DNA. Rather than attempting to separate the DNA
fragments, we take the complete mixture and use DNA ligase to insert the
fragments into the prepared vector. Under the right conditions, only one
fragment will be inserted into each vector molecule. In this way, we produce
a mixture of a large number of different recombinant vector molecules, which is
known as a gene library (or more specifically a genomic library, to contrast it
with other forms of gene library that will be described in Chapter 7). When we
transform a bacterial culture with this library, each cell will only take up one
molecule. When we then plate the transformed culture, each colony, which
arises from a single transformed cell, will contain a large number of bacteria all
of which carry the same recombinant plasmid, with a copy of the same piece of
DNA from our starting mixture. So instead of a mixture of thousands (or
millions, or tens of millions) of different DNA fragments, we have a large
number of bacterial colonies each of which carries one fragment only (Figure
3.4). The production and screening of gene libraries is considered in Chapters 7
and 8, where we will see that a variety of different vectors, other than simple
plasmids, are generally used for constructing genomic libraries.
We still have a very complex mixture, but whereas purifying an individual
DNA fragment is extremely difficult, it is simple to isolate individual bacterial
colonies from this mixture ± we just pick them from a plate. Each individual
bacterial colony will carry a different piece of DNA from our original complex
mixture, so if we can identify which bacterial colony carries the gene that we are
interested in, purifying it becomes a simple matter. We just have to pick the

right colony and inoculate it into fresh medium. However, we still have the
problem of knowing which of these thousands/millions of bacterial colonies
does actually carry the gene that we want. This is considered more fully in
Chapter 8, but one commonly used and very powerful method can be introduced here as an example. This depends on the phenomenon of hybridization.

3.4 Hybridization
If a double-stranded DNA fragment is heated, the non-covalent bonds holding
the two strands together will be disrupted, and the two strands will separate.
This is known as denaturation, or less formally (and less accurately) as
`melting'. When the solution is allowed to cool again, these bonds will reform

3.4

27

HYBRIDIZATION

and the original double-stranded fragment will be re-formed (the two strands
are said to anneal).
We can utilize this phenomenon to identify a specific piece of DNA in a
complex mixture by labelling a specific DNA sequence (the probe), and mixing
the labelled probe with the denatured mixture of fragments. When the mixture
is cooled down, the probe will tend to hybridize to any related DNA fragments
(Figure 3.5), which enables us to identify the specific DNA fragments that we
want.
For screening a gene library, the labelled probe will hybridize to DNA from
any colony that carries the corresponding gene or part of it; we can then
recover that colony and grow up a culture from it, thus producing an unlimited
amount of our cloned gene.
Of course it is not quite as simple as that ± we cannot hybridize the probe to
the colonies on an agar plate. However, it is easy to transfer a part of each
colony onto a membrane by replication, and then lyse the colony so that the
DNA it contains is fixed to the membrane. This produces a pattern of DNA
spots on the membrane in positions corresponding to the colonies on the
original plate (Figure 3.6), which can then be hybridized to the labelled probe
to enable identification, and recovery, of the required colony. Hybridization,
using labelled DNA or RNA probes, is an important part of many other
techniques that we will encounter in subsequent chapters.

3.5 Polymerase Chain Reaction
The technique known as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) often provides
an alternative to gene cloning and gene libraries as a way of obtaining usable
quantities of specific DNA sequences. PCR requires the use a pair of primers
that will anneal to sites at either side of the required region of DNA (Figure
3.7). DNA polymerase action will then synthesize new DNA strands starting
from each primer. Denaturation of the products, and re-annealing of the
primers, will allow a second round of synthesis. Repeated cycles of denaturation, annealing and extension will give rise to an exponential amplification of
the DNA sequence between the two primers, with the amount of product
doubling in each cycle, so that after say 20 cycles there will (theoretically) be

a million-fold increase in the amount of product. This enables the amplification
of a specific region of the DNA, and the product can then be cloned directly.
The polymerase chain reaction, and some of the many applications, are described more fully in Chapter 9.
In this chapter we have provided a brief overview of the principal methods
used in gene cloning. These procedures, and some of the main alternative
strategies, are described more fully in subsequent chapters.

4 Purification
and Separation of
Nucleic Acids
4.1 Extraction and Purification of Nucleic Acids
The first step for most of the procedures referred to in this book is to extract the
DNA (or for some purposes RNA) from the cell and to purify it by separating
it from other cellular components. Although recent technological advances
have made this much less of a challenge than it once was, the quality of the
starting material remains a crucially important factor for most purposes. For
some applications, such as PCR (see Chapter 9) or hybridization analyses (see
Chapter 8), less pure material may be acceptable. In this chapter, we review the
concepts underlying the most commonly used methods of purifying and fractionating nucleic acids; for further experimental details, you will need to
consult a laboratory manual (see Appendix A).

4.1.1 Breaking up cells and tissues
Although there are many different methods for purifying nucleic acids, they
have a number of basic features in common. Firstly, we need the starting
material. This could be a culture of bacterial or eukaryotic cells, which would
simply need to be separated from the growth medium (for example by centrifugation), or a more complex tissue sample, which first needs to be homogenized so that the individual cells can be lysed. Wherever possible, the material
should be freshly harvested or frozen until ready to use, to avoid degradation
by enzymes present in the cell extract.
The cells then need to be lysed to release their components. The nature of the
treatment will vary widely according to the cell type. Bacterial cells have walls
that have to be broken before the cell contents can be released. This is usually
accomplished by using lysozyme (an enzyme naturally present in egg white
and tears for the very purpose of breaking down bacterial cell walls), often
in conjunction with EDTA and a detergent such as SDS (sodium dodecyl

32

PURIFICATION AND SEPARATION OF NUCLEIC ACIDS

sulphate). EDTA eliminates divalent cations and thus destabilizes the outer
membrane in bacteria such as E. coli, and also inhibits DNases that would
otherwise tend to degrade the DNA, while the detergent will solubilize the
membrane lipids.
Plant and fungal cells have cell walls that are different from those in bacteria,
and require alternative treatments, either mechanical or enzymatic, while
animal cells (which lack a cell wall) can usually be lysed by more gentle
treatment with a mild detergent.
After breaking up cell walls, and plasma membrane, we find ourselves with a
mixture of that material and the intracellular components which have now been
released ± a complex solution of DNA, RNA, proteins, lipids and carbohydrates. Note that the sudden lysis of the cell will usually result in some fragmentation of chromosomal DNA. In particular, the bacterial chromosome, which is
usually circular in its native state, will be broken into linear fragments. Where it
is necessary to obtain very large (even intact) chromosomal DNA, more gentle
lysis conditions are necessary (see the description of pulsed field gel electrophoresis in Chapter 12). Bacterial plasmids, however, are readily obtained in their
native, circular, state by standard lysis conditions.
The next step in the procedure is to separate the desired nucleic acid from
these other components.

4.1.2 Enzyme treatment
Removal of RNA from a DNA preparation is easily achieved by treatment
with ribonuclease (RNase). Since RNase is a very heat-stable enzyme, it is easy
to ensure that it is free of traces of deoxyribonuclease (DNase) that would
otherwise degrade your DNA, simply by heating the enzyme before use.
Removal of DNA from RNA preparations used to be less easy, since it requires
DNase without any RNase activity. However, it is now possible to buy RNasefree DNase (as well as DNase-free ribonuclease). Protein contamination can be
removed by digestion with a proteolytic enzyme such as proteinase K.
These treatments are applied if necessary in different nucleic acid purification protocols. However, in some protocols they are omitted, either because the
contamination is unimportant for a specific purpose, or because the contaminants will be removed anyway through subsequent steps, as described below.

4.1.3 Phenol±chloroform extraction
Removal of proteins is particularly important as the cell contains a number of
enzymes that will degrade nucleic acids, as well as other proteins that will
interfere with subsequent procedures by binding to the nucleic acids. A

classical, and still very frequently employed way of removing proteins is by
extraction with liquefied phenol, or preferably a mixture of phenol and chloroform. Phenol and chloroform are (largely) immiscible with water, and so you
will get two layers (phases) when added to your cell extract. When the mixture
is vigorously agitated, the proteins will be denatured and precipitated at the
interphase (Figure 4.1). If you are using phenol that has been equilibrated with
a neutral or alkaline buffer (as is normally the case), the nucleic acids (DNA
and RNA) will remain in the aqueous layer. On the other hand, if you carry out
the extraction with acidic phenol, DNA will partition into the organic phase,
allowing you to recover RNA from the aqueous phase. Phenol is naturally
acidic, so equilibration with water, or the use of an acidic buffer, will produce
the appropriate conditions.
Phenol extraction is also useful in subsequent stages of manipulation when it
is necessary to ensure that all traces of an enzyme have been removed before
proceeding to the next step. (Note: phenol is highly toxic by skin absorption,
and gloves must be worn.)

4.1.4 Alcohol precipitation
Following phenol extraction, you will have a protein-free sample of your
nucleic acid(s). However, it will probably be more dilute than you want it to
be, and furthermore it will contain traces of phenol and chloroform. Phenol in
particular does have a significant degree of solubility in water, and could lead
to denaturation of enzymes in subsequent steps. The answer is normally to
concentrate (and further purify) the solution by precipitating the nucleic acid.
This is done by adding an alcohol, either isopropanol or (more frequently)
ethanol; in the presence of monovalent cations (Na , K or NH
4 ) a nucleic
acid precipitate forms which can be collected at the bottom of the test tube by

centrifugation (Figure 4.2). Some of the salt will precipitate as well and is
removed by washing with 70% ethanol.
The details of alcohol precipitation procedures vary according to the nature
of the nucleic acid; for example, low molecular weight DNA is much less
readily precipitated. This is not a major factor in the purification of DNA
from cell extracts, but does need to be considered at later stages, such as when
purifying small fragments of DNA.

4.1.5 Gradient centrifugation
Centrifugation at moderate speeds is frequently used in DNA purification for
the separation of particulate matter from a solution, whether it be the removal
of cellular debris or the recovery of precipitated nucleic acids. It is also
frequently employed in various column purification methods (see below).
Apart from these methods, an old method for separating nucleic acids, or
indeed any type of macromolecule, is to subject them to ultracentrifugation in
a density gradient. This includes the use of caesium salt gradients, usually with
the addition of ethidium bromide, for the separation of plasmid DNA from
bacterial genomic DNA, or of RNA from DNA. In addition, sucrose gradients
can be used for the size-selection of large DNA fragments when constructing a
genomic library. In these systems, DNA molecules are separated because of
differences in size and/or configuration (i.e. supercoiled versus relaxed). These
methods are still in use, but have to a large extent been replaced by far faster
and less cumbersome methods; therefore we will not consider them in detail
here.

4.1.6 Alkaline denaturation
This is a widely used procedure for separating plasmids from chromosomal
DNA in bacterial cell extracts. In a bacterial cell extract, chromosomal DNA

exists as linear fragments, due to the fragmentation that occurs during lysis of
the cell. Raising the pH to about 12 will disrupt the hydrogen bonds and allow
the linear strands to separate. Plasmids (especially the relatively small ones used
for gene cloning) are tougher and are not disrupted by cell lysis; they remain as
intact supercoiled circular DNA. Although the high pH will disrupt the hydrogen bonds, the two circular strands will not be able to separate physically, and
will remain interlinked. When the pH is reduced, the interlinked plasmid strands
will snap back to reform the double-stranded plasmid (Figure 4.3). On the other
hand, the separated linear chromosomal fragments cannot do this; instead they
will aggregate into an insoluble network that can be removed by centrifugation,
leaving the plasmids in solution. Other cell components, including cell wall
debris and many proteins, are also removed by this procedure, so phenol
extraction may not be needed (although it increases the stability of the extract).
The plasmid preparation obtained by this method is pure enough for many
purposes (including restriction digestion); when further purification is necessary this can be achieved using affinity matrices (see below).

4.1.7 Column purification
Two types of column purification are frequently used when purifying nucleic
acids, often by the aid of centrifugation (spin columns). In size-selection chromatography, a sample is passed through a matrix of small porous beads.
Smaller molecules, such as salts and unincorporated nucleotides, will enter
the beads, whereas larger molecules such as longer nucleic acid chains will pass

36

PURIFICATION AND SEPARATION OF NUCLEIC ACIDS

right through the column. This type of purification is a valuable tool and often
a fast and simple alternative to purification by alcohol precipitation.
In affinity chromatography purification, the macromolecules in your sample
will bind to the resin in the column. This could be an anionic resin, which binds
to the negatively charged phosphate groups in the nucleic acid backbone, or
more sophisticated ones such as resins coated with oligo-dT sequences, which
specifically bind to the poly-A tails of eukaryotic mRNA molecules (see
Chapter 7). In both cases, undesirable molecules can be washed from the
column, after which the stringency conditions are changed and the bound
nucleic acids eluted into a small volume of water or buffer.

4.2 Detection and Quantitation of Nucleic Acids
If your DNA preparation is reasonably pure (i.e. free of other materials that
absorb ultraviolet radiation, including RNA, free nucleotides, and proteins),
then you can estimate the DNA concentration by measuring the absorbance of
the solution in a spectrophotometer at 260 nm. This is convenient, but not very
sensitive: a solution of 50 mg/ml of double-stranded DNA will have an absorbance of 1. However, the presence of proteins or phenol will affect this estimate.
Furthermore, UV absorbance gives you no check on the integrity of your
DNA; it can be completely degraded and still give you a reading.
Dyes such as ethidium bromide are commonly used for both detecting and
quantitating nucleic acids. Ethidium bromide has a flat ring structure which is
able to stack in between the bases in nucleic acids; this is known as intercalation. The dye can then be detected by its fluorescence (in the red±orange
region of the spectrum) when exposed to UV irradiation. This is the most
widely used method for staining electrophoresis gels (see below), and can also
be used for estimating the amount of DNA (or RNA) in your sample, by
comparing the intensity of the fluorescence with a sample of known concentration run on the same gel.
Note that ethidium bromide is mutagenic, and precaution must be taken to
eliminate health risks. Alternative, less hazardous, dyes are increasingly being
used for this purpose.

4.3 Gel Electrophoresis
Gel electrophoresis is a crucial technique for both the analysis and the purification of nucleic acids. When a charged molecule is placed in an electric field, it
will migrate towards the electrode with the opposite charge; nucleic acid
molecules, being negatively charged, will move towards the positive pole
(anode). In a gel, which consists of a complex network of pores, the rate at

4.3

GEL ELECTROPHORESIS

37

which a nucleic acid molecule moves will be determined by its ability to
penetrate through this network. For linear fragments of double-stranded
DNA within a certain size range, this will reflect the size of the molecule (i.e.
the length of the DNA). We do not have to consider the amount of charge that
the molecule carries (unlike some other applications of electrophoresis), since
all nucleic acids carry the same amount of charge per unit size.
The effective size range of a gel is determined by its composition. We can use
agarose gels for separating nucleic acid molecules greater than a few hundred
base pairs, reducing the agarose concentration to obtain effective separation of
larger fragments, or increasing it for small fragments. For even smaller molecules, down to only a few tens of base pairs, we would use polyacrylamide gels.

4.3.1 Analytical gel electrophoresis
We can therefore use agarose gel electrophoresis for analysing the composition
and quality of a nucleic acid sample. In particular, it is invaluable for determining the size of DNA fragments from a restriction digest or the products of a
PCR reaction (see Chapter 9). For this purpose it is necessary to calibrate the
gel by running a standard marker containing fragments of known sizes; in
Figure 4.4, the standard marker is provided by a HindIII digest of DNA from
the lambda bacteriophage. It can be seen that over much of the size range, there
is a linear relationship between the logarithm of the fragment size and the
distance it has moved. From this calibration graph, you can then estimate the
size of your unknown fragment(s) ± assuming they are linear double-stranded
DNA (see below).
The reason for the non-linearity of the curve with larger DNA molecules is
that these molecules move through the gel in a different way. Although these
molecules are large, they are also very thin, and they can in effect slither through
the gel end-on. It takes some time for them to become lined up, but once they
are, then the rate at which they move is largely independent of their size. So for a
particular gel, all molecules above a certain size will have virtually the same
mobility. In the gel shown, all DNA molecules larger than about 20 kb will not
be separated, but the use of gels with a lower agarose concentration will extend
the size range. Special techniques, involving frequent switching of the direction
of the electric field, are available for separating very large DNA molecules ± see
the description of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) in Chapter 12.
If a more precise confirmation of the nature of the sample is required, the gel
is blotted onto a membrane support, and hybridized with a nucleic acid probe
(see the section on Southern blotting in Chapter 8).
Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis offers a much sharper size-separation of
nucleic acid molecules, down to the separation of fragments that only differ in
size by one single base. This is used in methods such as primer extension analysis

and gel retardation (or band shift) assays (see Chapter 13), and has formed the
basis for the development of DNA sequencing methods (Chapter 10).
Not all DNA molecules are linear. Native plasmids are supercoiled circular
molecules, but if a plasmid is nicked (i.e. one of the strands is broken) the loose
ends are free to rotate, and it adopts a relaxed, open circular form. A double
strand break will produce a linearized plasmid (see Figure 4.5). Although all
three forms are the same size (in terms of the number of base pairs), they will
move differently in a gel, with the open circular form moving more slowly
than either the linear or the supercoiled DNA. The relative mobility of the
latter two forms is more difficult to predict, and will depend on the size and the
electrophoretic conditions. It is therefore quite normal for a purified plasmid
preparation to show two or three bands in a gel; it does not necessarily mean
that there is more than one plasmid. (A further complication is that there may
be dimeric or multimeric forms of the plasmid present.)

Most RNA molecules you will encounter are single-stranded, and in some
cases (such as in DNA sequencing) we will come across single-stranded DNA
as well. These need special consideration. As described in Chapter 2, singlestranded nucleic acids will tend to fold up into complex secondary structures,
so as to remove the hydrophobic bases from the aqueous environment. The
migration of the molecule will be greatly influenced by the way it folds. If we
want to get a true picture of its size, we have to make sure that it remains in an
unfolded state. To do this, we use denaturing gels, in which denaturing agents
such as urea or formaldehyde are included.

4.3.2 Preparative gel electrophoresis
Gel electrophoresis is also an important tool in the purification of a specific
nucleic acid fragment from a complex mixture. In this case, using a lowmelting-point preparation of agarose makes it easier to recover the DNA
fragment. After separating the sample, it is visualized with ethidium bromide.
With the gel still on the transilluminator, and using suitable equipment to
protect yourself from the UV radiation, the band(s) that need to be purified
are excised using a razor blade or scalpel. The DNA can then be recovered and
purified from the gel fragment, using standard DNA purification procedures.

5 Cutting and Joining DNA
5.1 Restriction Endonucleases
Restriction endonucleases, the enzymes that are used to cut DNA molecules in
specific places, derive their name from the phenomenon of host-controlled
restriction and modification. This can occur when a bacteriophage preparation
grown using one bacterial strain is used to infect a different strain. For
example, phage grown using E. coli strain C will infect E. coli strain K very
inefficiently. E. coli K restricts the growth of the phage obtained from E. coli C.
The reason for this restriction of phage growth is that E. coli K produces an
endonuclease, which is therefore known as a restriction endonuclease, that cuts
DNA into pieces, so that the incoming phage DNA is rapidly broken down and
only occasionally escapes to produce phage progeny (Figure 5.1). The host
DNA must be protected against the action of the endonuclease, and this is
achieved by a second enzyme that modifies DNA, by methylation, so that it is
not attacked by the endonuclease. Although this phenomenon was initially
demonstrated with bacteriophage infection, and this is the easiest way of
studying it, it can also occur whenever DNA is transferred between one
bacterial strain and another, including plasmid transfer ± or genetically engineered DNA. If the receiving strain possesses a restriction/modification system
that is not present in the originating host, then the yields of transformants or
recombinants will be very low.
The E. coli K restriction enzyme is not actually very useful for our purposes,
since it does not generate specific fragments. It recognizes specific sequences in
the DNA but does not cut them. Instead it tracks along the DNA for a variable
distance, sometimes as far as 5 kb, before breaking the DNA strand. Enzymes
of this type are known as Type I restriction endonucleases. The enzymes that
are commonly used, known as Type II restriction endonucleases, typically
recognize and cut within (or immediately adjacent to) specific target sequences
and therefore generate specific fragments. A small number of Type II restriction enzymes cut the DNA at a defined distance (usually only a few bases) away
from the recognition site. The applications of such enzymes are limited and
they will not be considered further.

5.1.1 Specificity
A very large number of Type II restriction endonucleases have been characterized and are used in DNA manipulations. These are identified firstly by the
name of the organism from which they are obtained, using the first letter of the
genus and the first two letters of the species name, together with a suffix
indicating the specific enzyme from that species. Thus PstI indicates a specific
enzyme obtained from the bacterium Providencia stuartii, and HaeI, HaeII, and
HaeIII indicate three different enzymes, with different specificities, from Haemophilus aegyptius. The convention is to write the first part (derived from the
name of the source organism) in italics, just as you would with the species name.
Some examples are shown in Box 5.1, together with their recognition sequences and the position of the site at which they break the DNA. One of the
key parameters that affects the way in which we use these enzymes is the length
of the recognition site, which will affect the frequency with which they cut
DNA, and hence the average size of the fragments generated. For example,
take the enzyme Sau3A, which has a 4-base recognition site, GATC. If we
assume, for the moment, that there is an equal proportion of all four bases, and

Only one strand of the recognition site is shown, with a slash (/) showing the position
of the cleavage site. All the examples shown are palindromic, so the sequence of the
second strand, read as the reverse complement, and the position of the cleavage site,
will be the same as that shown. Thus the reverse complement of 5H -GAATTC-3H is
also 5H -GAATTC-3, and both strands are cut by EcoRI between G and A.

also that the bases are randomly distributed, then at any position on the
chromosome there is a one in four chance that it is a G. Then there is a one
in four chance that the next base is an A; the chance of having the sequence GA
is the product of the two, or 1 in 42 (1 in 16). Extending the argument, the
chance of the sequence GAT occurring is 1 in 43 , and that of the 4-base
sequence GATC is 1 in 44 , or 1 in 256. So this enzyme (and any others with a
4-base recognition site) would cut DNA (on these assumptions) on average
every 44 bases, and so would generate a set of fragments with an average size of
256 bases. The actual sizes of the fragments will be distributed quite widely on
either side of this average value. A six-base site such as that recognized by
EcoRI (GAATTC) would occur every 46 bases (or 4096 bases). To give some
perspective to this calculation, a moderately sized protein might have about
300 amino acids and would therefore be coded for by a DNA sequence of 900
bases in length (ignoring the possible presence of introns). So a four-base
cutting enzyme would often give fragments much smaller than a whole gene.
On the other hand a bacterial genome of perhaps 4 Â 106 bases (4 Mb) would

44

CUTTING AND JOINING DNA

be expected (given the same assumptions) to be cut into about 1000 fragments
by an enzyme such as EcoRI.
Of course the assumptions in this calculation are not necessarily valid.
Firstly, we assumed an equal proportion of all four bases. If we consider
both strands of a double-stranded DNA, the number of G and C residues is
equal, since for every G on one strand there is a C on the other, and vice versa.
Similarly the number of A residues is the same as the number of T residues.
(This equality of G and C, and of A and T, does not apply in the same way to
each strand taken individually ± but they are in fact usually nearly balanced.)
So we can simplify the examination of base composition by comparing the
number of GC bases to the number of AT residues. This is commonly
expressed as the percentage of (GC), or GC%. This parameter can vary
widely from one species to another. For E. coli, our assumption is valid, as
the GC content is actually 50% , but other fully-sequenced genomes range from
37% GC (Staphylococcus aureus) to 72% GC (Streptomyces coelicolor). For
an organism with a high proportion of GC bases in its DNA, the predicted
number of EcoRI sites (GAATTC) will be lower than in the calculation above.
Furthermore, the sequence of bases is not random; for various reasons some
combinations of bases occur much less often than would be expected. Some
sites are therefore significantly under-represented in the genome as a whole.
The occurrence of a specific site may even vary from one region of the genome
to another.
A further factor that will affect the ability of restriction endonucleases to cut
DNA is methylation of the DNA. We have already seen that each restriction
endonuclease, in its original host, will be accompanied by a modifying enzyme
that protects the chromosomal DNA against cleavage by the endonuclease, by
methylation of the same sequence. In addition, most laboratory strains of E.
coli contain two site-specific DNA methyltransferases (methylases). The Dam
methylase catalyses methylation of the adenine residues in the sequence
GATC, while the Dcm methylase modifies the internal cytosine in the sequences CCAGG and CCTGG. Methylation at these positions may make
the DNA resistant to attack by restriction enzymes that cut the DNA at sites
containing these sequences (see Box 5.1). Methyltransferases also occur in
eukaryotes, especially the CpG methylase which modifies the cytosine in
some sites containing the dinucleotide CpG. Although these are not known
to be involved in restriction/modification systems, they can affect the ability of
restriction enzymes to cut certain sites in DNA from higher eukaryotes. A
further complication is that many E. coli strains have restriction systems
(McrA, McrBC, Mrr) that attack DNA that is methylated at CpG sites, and
the recovery of cloned DNA from mammals and higher plants can be reduced
in such strains. The full implications of methylation of DNA are too complex
to be dealt with here, beyond saying that it may be necessary to consider these
factors when selecting restriction enzymes and E. coli host strains.

5.1

RESTRICTION ENDONUCLEASES

Although most of the commonly used enzymes recognize either four base or
six base sites, (or in some cases five bases) there are also important roles for
enzymes that cut even less frequently, such as NotI and PacI (see Box 5.1).
These both have eight base recognition sites, which might be expected to occur
(on average) every 48 bases (about 65 kb), but the sequences are far from
random (being composed entirely of GC or AT respectively) so a given
DNA sequence may be assumed to contain very few sites (or even none at all)
for one or the other of these enzymes, depending on the base composition.

5.1.2 Sticky and blunt ends
Another important parameter that affects the use we make of restriction
enzymes is the position of the cut site within the recognition sequence. In this
context it should be noted that most (but not all) restriction endonuclease
recognition sites are termed palindromic, although the term is not strictly
accurate. A verbal palindrome, for example `radar' reads the same from left
to right as from right to left. A restriction site `palindrome', such as GAATTC,
is a bit different. At first glance it does not seem to be the same when read in the
other direction, but you have to remember that the two strands of DNA lie in
opposite directions. When we write GAATTC we are looking at the sequence
of the `top' strand, which runs 5H to 3H when read from left to right ± so we
should write the sequence as 5H GAATTC3H . On the `bottom' (complementary)
strand, we have to read from right to left to see the 5H to 3H sequence, which
would also be 5H GAATTC3H (see Figure 5.2).
Within this sequence, the restriction enzyme EcoRI will cut the DNA between the G and the A on each strand, and will hence produce fragments with
four bases unpaired at the 5H end (Figure 5.3). These four bases (AATT) are the
same on all fragments generated with this enzyme, and these ends are complementary to one another. They will thus tend to form base pairs, and so help to
stick the fragments together. They are therefore referred to as cohesive or sticky
ends. It should be noted that the base pairing formed with a sequence of four
bases is very weak and would not be stable, so we need to use DNA ligase to
finally join the fragments together with a covalent bond to form a recombinant

molecule (see below). Nevertheless, the limited cohesiveness of these ends does
make the ligation process much more efficient.
Some enzymes, such as PstI, also form cohesive ends, but by cutting asymmetrically within the right-hand part of the recognition site; they thus generate
sticky ends with unpaired single-strand sequences at the 3H ends of the fragment
(Figure 5.4).
Although enzymes that generate cohesive ends are useful for gene cloning
because of the efficiency of the ligation process, there is a limitation. You can
only join together fragments with compatible ends. So two EcoRI fragments
can be ligated to each other, or two BamHI fragments can be joined, but you
cannot ligate an EcoRI fragment directly to a BamHI fragment. However,
there are circumstances in which compatible ends can be generated by different
restriction enzymes. For example, the restriction enzymes BamHI and BglII
recognize different sequences (see Box 5.1), but they both generate the same
sticky ends (with unpaired GATC sequences) and these can be joined.
More flexibility can be achieved by using an enzyme such as SmaI, which
recognizes the six base sequence CCCGGG and cuts symmetrically at the
centre position (see Figure 5.4); it generates blunt ends, which although much

less efficiently ligated have the advantage that they can be joined to any other
blunt-ended fragment.

5.1.3 Isoschizomers
An additional element of flexibility arises from the existence of several enzymes
that recognize the same sequence of bases. These are known as isoschizomers
(Greek iso, equal; skhizo, to split). In many cases, isoschizomers not only have
the same recognition site, but cut in the same place within that recognition
sequence. Although this can be of some use, for technical reasons we don't need
to go into, more important are examples of isoschizomers which recognize the
same sequence but cut in a different position within that sequence. For
example, Acc65I and KpnI both recognize the sequence GGTACC (Figure
5.5), but cut it at a different place. They therefore generate different sticky
ends. This gives you the option of obtaining virtually the same fragment of
DNA but with different sticky ends that can be ligated to other fragments.
Another example is the pair of isoschizomers XmaI and SmaI. XmaI cuts
asymmetrically and produces sticky ends that can be ligated to other XmaI

fragments, while SmaI, as mentioned above, will generate blunt-ended fragments at the same site, allowing you to ligate the fragment to other blunt-ended
DNA sequences. (You could object that these enzymes are not literally `samecutters', which is true if you look at the actual site where the break is made.
However, the fragments generated by cutting a DNA molecule with XmaI, for
example, will be the same size as those generated by SmaI, so you will see
identical patterns on an agarose gel, even though the ends of the fragments are
different.)

5.1.4 Processing restriction fragments
After a restriction digestion, if a digest produces more than one fragment, the
fragments will normally need to be separated on a low-melting-point agarose

5.2

LIGATION

49

gel, and the desired fragment excised and purified (see Chapter 4). Alternatively, if the digest produces only one fragment, or if a complex mixture is being
digested for the production of a library (see Chapter 7), it is normally sufficient
to inactivate the enzyme before continuing with the next stage. Normally, this
is accomplished by heat-inactivation; the efficiency of this will have been
specified by the supplier in their product information sheet. If the enzyme is
heat-stable, phenol extraction is necessary to ensure inactivation.
Later in this chapter we will look at ways in which the ends of DNA
fragments generated by restriction endonuclease cleavage can be modified to
make the cloning process easier and more versatile. This includes converting
sticky ends to blunt ends, by filling in the missing bases complementary to the
unpaired ends or by digesting away the single-stranded regions. We will also
consider the use of linkers and adaptors ± short synthetic DNA fragments that
add new restriction sites to the end of a fragment, thus enabling fragments
generated in different ways to be joined together.
We also need to be aware that DNA fragments for ligation can be generated
in ways other than by cleavage with restriction endonucleases, ranging from the
non-specific generation of truly random fragments (by mechanical shearing or
digestion with non-specific nucleases) through reverse transcription of mRNA
into DNA (see Chapter 7) to the highly specific amplification of a chosen piece
of DNA by PCR (Chapter 9) and the use of synthetic DNA (Chapter 15).

5.2 Ligation
As outlined in Chapter 3, the next stage in cloning a gene is to join the DNA
fragment to a vector molecule, such as a plasmid or bacteriophage, that can be
replicated by the host cell after transformation. The joining, or ligation, of
DNA fragments is carried out by an enzyme known as DNA ligase.
The natural role of DNA ligase is to repair single-strand breaks (nicks) in the
sugar±phosphate backbone of a double-stranded DNA molecule, such as may
occur through damage to DNA (or following the repair of such damage), as well
as the joining of the short fragments produced as a consequence of replication of
the `lagging strand' during DNA replication. The action of the ligase requires
that the nick should expose a 3H -OH group and a 5H -phosphate (Figure 5.6).
Digestion with restriction endonucleases cuts the DNA in this way, i.e. it leaves
the phosphate on the 5H position of the deoxyribose. The unstable pairing of two
restriction fragments with compatible sticky ends can therefore be considered as
a double-stranded DNA molecule with a nick in each strand, very close together, and is therefore a substrate for DNA ligase action.
Some DNA ligases, such as T4 DNA ligase (encoded by the bacteriophage
T4), are also capable of ligating blunt-ended fragments, albeit much less

efficiently, while others (notably the E. coli DNA ligase) are not; they require
pairing of overlapping ends. To keep things simple, we will only consider the
action of T4 DNA ligase, which is by far the most extensively used one. We will
refer to this enzyme as T4 ligase (or just `ligase') although there is also a (much
less commonly used) T4 RNA ligase.
The T4 ligase requires ATP as a co-substrate. In the first step, the ligase reacts
with ATP to form a covalent enzyme-AMP complex, which in turn reacts with
the 5H -phosphate on one side of the nick, transferring the AMP to the phosphate
group. The final stage is the attack by the 3H -OH group, forming a new covalent
phosphodiester bond (thus restoring the integrity of the sugar±phosphate backbone) and releasing AMP. The absolute requirement for the 5H -phosphate is
extremely important; by removing the 5H -phosphate we can prevent the occurrence of unwanted ligation (see below).

5.2

LIGATION

51

5.2.1 Optimizing ligation conditions
Ligation can be one of the most unpredictable (and often frustrating) steps in
the cloning process. Factors that may compromise the success of ligation
include the presence of inhibitory material contaminating our DNA preparations and degradation of the enzyme or the DNA (including loss of the 5H phosphate). In addition, the conditions need to be adjusted correctly to achieve
the optimum effect. One of the most controversial of these conditions is
temperature. Originally, it was considered that since ligation was in effect a
repair of single strand nicks in a double-strand molecule, we should optimize
the pairing of the fragments. Therefore, much of the early work used ligation at
108C (or even 48C ), which needs long incubation since the enzyme activity is
low at that temperature. Fashions change, and many protocols now recommend 168C, but this is inconvenient unless you have a cooled water bath to
hand; room temperature is often used as a compromise. Technological advances have also meant that buffers are commercially available that allow
much faster and more efficient ligations.
Since the reaction we want normally involves two different molecules of
DNA (intermolecular ligation), we would expect it to be extremely sensitive
to DNA concentration. It is therefore important to use high concentrations of
DNA; but which DNA component? We have two components: the vector and
the insert (ignoring for the moment the fact that the insert may itself be a
heterogeneous mixture of fragments). There are therefore a variety of possible
reactions that can occur (Figure 5.7), and by adjusting the relative amounts of
the components, as well as the overall concentration of DNA, we can influence
the likelihood of these different reactions.
At low concentrations of DNA, we are more likely to get the two ends of the
same molecule joining (an intramolecular reaction), since the rate of a reaction
involving one component will be linearly related to its concentration, whereas a
reaction involving two different components will be proportional to the product
of the two concentrations. (Or for a reaction involving two molecules of the
same substrate, the rate will be proportional to the square of the concentration.)
If we increase the concentration of the vector but not the insert, we will get a
greater increase in the ligation of two vector molecules together (which we
don't want) than in the production of the recombinant vector±insert product.
Conversely, increasing insert concentration will give increased levels of insert±
insert dimers (which we also do not want, although they are less of a problem as
they will not give rise to transformants).
So we need not only to keep the overall DNA concentration high, but also to
create an optimum vector±insert ratio. It is not easy to predict reliably what
that ratio should be but typically it would range from 3:1 to 1:3. Note that these
are molar ratios and have to take account of the relative size of the vector and

the insert. For example, if the vector is 5 kb and the insert is 500 bases, then a
1:1 molar ratio would involve 10 times as much vector, by weight, as insert (e.g.
500 ng of vector and 50 ng of insert). Conversely, for the same 5 kb vector
but an insert size of 50 kb, if you used 500 ng of vector you would need 5 mg
of insert to achieve a 1:1 molar ratio. In general, to convert the amount of
DNA by weight into a value that can be used to calculate the molar ratio,
divide the amount used (by weight) by the size of the DNA. Thus, if WV and WI
are the weights used of vector and insert DNA respectively, and SV , SI are the
sizes of vector and insert (e.g. in kilobases), then the vector:insert ratio is
WV =SV : WI =SI .
A further complication arises if we are working with a heterogeneous collection of potential insert fragments, as would be the case if we were making a
gene library (see Chapter 7). Loading more insert DNA into the ligation
mixture will increase the possibility of obtaining multiple inserts. In other
words, we may produce recombinant plasmids that carry two or more completely different pieces of DNA. This is not a good idea. It can lead to seriously
misleading results when we come to characterize the clones in the library and
try to relate them to the structure of the genome of our starting organism.
So adjusting the relative amount of the vector and insert will not only
influence the success of ligation but will also have an effect on the nature of
the products formed. Intramolecular ligation of vector molecules, or formation

5.3 ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE

53

of vector dimers, will result in transformants that do not carry our insert, while
putting in too much insert will result in insert dimers (which will not give
transformants) or recombinant plasmids carrying multiple inserts. Fortunately
we do not have to rely entirely on adjusting the levels of DNA in order to
obtain the result that we want. In the next section, we will look at the use of
alkaline phosphatase to remove 5H -phosphate groups (thus preventing some
types of ligation), and in Chapter 6 we will consider designs of vector that allow
us to distinguish between recombinant and non-recombinant transformants.

5.3 Alkaline Phosphatase
As described above, the ligation process depends absolutely on the presence of
a 5H -phosphate at the nick site. If this phosphate group is removed, that site
cannot be ligated. Removal of 5H -phosphate groups is achieved with an enzyme
known as alkaline phosphatase (because of its optimum pH) ± the most
commonly used enzyme is calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP). Treatment of the
vector molecule with CIP before ligation will remove the 5H -phosphates, and so
make it impossible for self-ligation of the vector (either intramolecular or
intermolecular) to occur. Ligation of vector to insert can occur, however, as
the insert still has its 5H -phosphates. It is of course important to remove the CIP
before ligation, and this is best done by phenol extraction and subsequent
ethanol precipitation as heat inactivation is not sufficiently reliable. If you
are using the same vector repeatedly, it is possible to carry this out on a larger
scale and store the unused treated vector for further experiments. This is
desirable as CIP treatment is not entirely reliable, and a bulk preparation of
dephosphorylated vector that you have already used successfully is a considerable asset in subsequent experiments. If you are using a standard vector, you
can buy ready-made and tested dephosphorylated vector.
However, further inspection of the situation (Figure 5.8) will reveal that it is
not quite that simple. At each junction between two DNA fragments there are
two nicks that need repairing. At one of these, the 5H -phosphate is supplied by
the insert, and that can be ligated normally. However, at the other nick, there
should be a 5H -phosphate on the vector, and that has been removed. So the
second nick cannot be mended. How can we deal with this situation?
Actually it is not a real problem. The recombinant plasmid will have two
unrepaired nicks in its (circular) DNA (one at each end of the inserted fragment) ± but it will hold together very stably by virtue of the base pairing all
along the inserted DNA fragment. So we have hundreds, or thousands, of base
pairs holding the two strands together. It will be maintained stably at 378C, as a
double-stranded molecule.
When this nicked molecule is introduced into a bacterial cell by transformation, enzymes within the cell will rapidly repair the remaining nicks, by adding

the missing phosphates and ligating the broken ends. The plasmid will be
replicated without any difficulty.
Potentially some of the other problems still remain. We could still get insert
dimers, or multiple inserts. However, since we no longer have to worry about
self-ligation of the vector, we can increase vector concentration relative to the
insert and thus drive the reaction in the direction we want.
Even so, if we are making a gene library, when the possibility of multiple
inserts is at its most serious as a problem, we may want to turn this strategy on
its head. Phosphatase treatment of the insert rather than the vector will prevent
multiple inserts, and we can prevent the occurrence of non-recombinant transformants (carrying self-ligated vector rather than vector±insert recombinants)
by using special vectors that are unable to produce clones unless they carry an
inserted DNA fragment (see Chapter 6).

5.4 Double Digests
There are good reasons to try to avoid using alkaline phosphatase if possible.
The treatment easily overdigests, not only removing the phosphate group but
modifying and disabling the sticky end. In addition, the required phenol
extraction and ethanol precipitation are time-consuming (and can also result
in loss of, or damage to, the DNA). If you are simply trying to make a specific
recombinant plasmid, and have efficient ways of differentiating self-ligated

5.5 MODIFICATION OF RESTRICTION FRAGMENT ENDS

55

vectors, a perfectly optimal ligation is not essential. You will only need one
clone eventually, and as long as you can identify this without trawling through
hundreds of others you will be content.
However, there are circumstances when it is necessary to be able to ensure
that a high proportion of the colonies obtained are genuine recombinants. For
example, if you are trying to create a representative DNA library, self-ligated
vectors and multiple inserts are a real problem. Even simple binary ligations
can sometimes be problematic, in particular if you happen to do a ligation
where there is no easy way of rapidly differentiating recombinant plasmids
from self-ligated vectors (see Chapter 6).
If you want to avoid the use of alkaline phosphatase, one alternative method
of avoiding self-ligation of vector and insert is to cut both components with
two different restriction enzymes. Indeed, you may want to do this for other
reasons anyway. Most modern vectors have multiple cloning sites (see Chapter
6) so you can cut the vector with, for example, EcoRI and BamHI. Provided
that both enzymes have cut efficiently (and that you have removed the small
fragment between the two sites), then vector re-ligation will be impossible. If
your insert fragment has been digested with the same two enzymes, then
virtually all the colonies obtained will be recombinant, i.e. they will contain
the insert fragment. There are still some other possible reactions, such as
ligation of two vector molecules together, but these events will be comparatively rare.
There are two sorts of problem with double digests. The first is to find
conditions that allow both enzymes to work. Suppliers' catalogues often contain tables of recommended buffers for a variety of combinations of restriction
enzymes. Enzymes that require widely different temperatures are more difficult, and you may have to use the enzymes sequentially. The second problem
occurs if the two sites are close together. Some restriction enzymes do not cut
very efficiently at a recognition site that is near to the end of a DNA molecule.
Again, some suppliers' catalogues provide tables that allow you to determine if
this is a problem. However, even if you do everything by the book, you may
still find that you get incomplete digestion, and it is necessary to carry out
control ligations to test the efficiency of the double digest.

5.5 Modification of Restriction Fragment Ends
Restriction fragments with sticky ends are useful as they can be readily ligated.
However, there is a limitation on their usefulness, as they can only be ligated to
another fragment with compatible ends. So an EcoRI fragment can be ligated
to another EcoRI fragment, but not to one generated by BamHI. Not only do
you lose the advantage of the cohesive ends, but the unpaired DNA gets in the
way, making you better off with blunt-ended fragments.

56

CUTTING AND JOINING DNA

This is a potential nuisance, as the vector you are using will only have a
limited number of possible sites into which you can insert DNA (and you may
specifically want to put your insert in a particular position), and it may not be
possible to generate a suitable insert with the same enzyme. In this section we
will look at ways in which you can change the ends of a DNA fragment to
enable it to be ligated with other sites.

5.5.1 Trimming and filling
One strategy that enables a more flexible use of restriction fragments is to
convert the sticky ends into blunt ends, either by filling in the complementary
strand, or by trimming back the unpaired sequence (see Figure 5.9). If the
restriction fragment has a 5H overhang (such as those generated by EcoRI), the
3H OH group provides a primer site that can be extended by DNA polymerases,
thus filling in the recessed end and converting it to double-stranded. However,
some DNA polymerases (such as E. coli DNA polymerase I) also have 5H ±3H
exonuclease activity, which would remove the 5H overhang (and maybe more);
these enzymes are not suitable for filling in the ends. Therefore, for this purpose
you would use an enzyme lacking this 5H ±3H exonuclease activity such as the
Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I (a proteolytic product of E. coli
DNA polymerase I in which the region responsible for the 5H ± 3H exonuclease
activity has been removed).

Restriction fragments with 3H sticky ends, such as those produced by PstI,
cannot be filled in, but the unpaired sequences can be trimmed back, using the
3H ± 5H exonuclease activity of an enzyme such as T4 DNA polymerase.

5.5.2 Linkers and adapters
Both of the above procedures, filling in or trimming back, result in conversion of
sticky ends to blunt ends, which can then be ligated to any other blunt-ended
fragment, however produced. This is a start, but it is still some way short of the
complete versatility that is our goal, especially as blunt-end ligation is so inefficient, and requires a much higher concentration of DNA (which may be difficult
to come by). The process can be made much more efficient, and much more
versatile, by the use of linkers. These are short synthetic pieces of DNA that
contain a restriction site. For example, the sequence CCGGATCCGG contains
the BamHI site (GGATCC). Furthermore it is self-complementary, so you only
need to synthesize (or buy) one strand; two molecules of it will anneal to produce
a double-stranded DNA fragment 10 base pairs long (see Figure 5.10). If this is
joined to a blunt-ended potential insert fragment by blunt-end ligation, your
fragment now will have a BamHI site near each end. Cutting this with BamHI
will generate a fragment with BamHI sticky ends, that can be ligated with a
BamHI-cut vector. If your insert already has an internal BamHI site, this is not
possible. The alternative is to use adapters rather than linkers (see below).
You may object that this still requires blunt-end ligation, to join the linker to
the potential insert. However, the efficiency of blunt-end ligation can be
markedly improved by using high concentrations of at least one of the components. In this case, you can easily produce and use large amounts of the
linker. Furthermore, since the linker is very small (e.g. 10 bases), and it is the
molar concentration that is important, even modest amounts of the linker by
mass will represent an enormous excess of linker in molar terms. For example,
if you use 100 ng of a 1 kb insert, then 10 ng of linker will represent a 10:1
linker:insert ratio. The high molar concentration of the linker will drive the
reaction very effectively. Of course, this efficient ligation is likely to add
multiple copies of the linker to the ends of your insert, but this is not a problem
± the subsequent restriction digestion will remove them.
Further versatility can be obtained by the use of adapters. These are pairs of
short oligonucleotides that are designed to anneal together in such a way as to
create a short double-stranded DNA fragment with different sticky ends (or
with one sticky and one blunt end). For example the sequences 5H GATCCCCGGG and 5H -AATTCCCGGG will anneal as shown in Figure
5.11 to produce a fragment with a BamHI sticky end at one end and an
EcoRI sticky end at the other, without needing to be cut by a restriction
enzyme. Ligation of this adaptor to a restriction fragment generated by BamHI

digestion will produce a DNA fragment with EcoRI ends that can now be
ligated with an EcoRI cut vector.
Alternatively, an adaptor with one sticky end and one blunt end can be used
to convert blunt-ended DNA fragments, such as those generated by cDNA
synthesis (see Chapter 7), into fragments with a sticky end, which increases the
cloning efficiency substantially. As with linkers, you can use high molar
concentrations of adaptors to drive ligation very efficiently, and the use of
adapters with non-phosphorylated sticky ends ensures that you will not get
multiple additions of the adaptor to the end of your DNA fragment.

5.5.3 Homopolymer tailing
An alternative way of adding sticky ends to DNA molecules is to use the
enzyme terminal deoxynucleotide transferase (or terminal transferase for

short). When supplied with a single deoxynucleotide triphosphate (say dGTP),
this enzyme will repetitively add nucleotides to the 3H OH end of a DNA
molecule (Figure 5.12). This enzyme is different from DNA polymerases in
that it does not require a template strand, so this reaction will produce a
molecule with a single-stranded run of G residues at each 3H end, hence the
term homopolymer tailing. If the vector is treated in this way, and the insert
fragment(s) are treated with terminal transferase and dCTP (generating a tail
of C residues), the two tails are complementary and will tend to anneal to one
another (see Figure 5.13).
It is not possible to ensure that the tails are all exactly the same length, so
when the molecules anneal together there will be gaps in one of the sequences.
This does not matter. If the tails are longer than about 20 nucleotides, then the
pairing of the tails will be strong enough to be stable at room temperature, and

within the host cell after transformation.
One advantage of this strategy is that it is not possible for the vector to
reform without an insert: the ends of the vector are not complementary to one
another. The downside is that you have constructed a recombinant plasmid
that contains a variable number of GC base pairs at either end of the insert, so
it lacks the precision associated with formation of a recombinant using the
other methods described in this chapter. This is a disadvantage if you want to
recover the insert from the recombinant vector, for example to reclone it in
another vector. However, you can use restriction sites in the flanking region of
the vector to release the insert. Or you can sequence the ends of the insert and
use that information to design PCR primers (see Chapter 9) to allow you to
specifically amplify the insert.

5.6 Other ways of joining DNA molecules
5.6.1 TA cloning of PCR products
Some of the polymerases used in PCR amplification (see Chapter 9) also have a
(very limited) terminal transferase action: they add a single adenosine residue to

the 3H ends of the synthesized strands. This can cause problems with cloning, as
the ends are not truly blunt, so blunt-end cloning is likely to be unsuccessful.
However, it provides an opportunity as well as a problem. There are commercially available `TA vectors', which are supplied in linearized form with a single
3H -T `overhang' which is compatible with the unpaired 3H -A on the PCR product
(see Figure 5.14). This concept can be combined with topoisomerase cloning
(see below) to form a highly efficient way of cloning such PCR products.
Alternative strategies include designing the PCR primers to incorporate a
restriction site; the product can then be digested with the appropriate enzyme
before ligation in the conventional manner. The strategies for cloning PCR
products are considered further in Chapter 9.

5.6.2 DNA topoisomerase
Although DNA ligase is the most commonly used enzyme for joining two
DNA molecules, it is not the only enzyme that can carry out this action.
DNA topoisomerase I is another example. Topoisomerases in general are
responsible for controlling the degree of supercoiling of DNA (see Chapter
2); type I topoisomerases achieve this by cutting one DNA strand, which is then
free to rotate (thus reducing the supercoiling), and subsequently rejoining the
cut ends of the DNA strands. The enzyme remains covalently attached to the

62

CUTTING AND JOINING DNA

phosphate group at the end of the broken strand after cutting it, thus retaining
the bond energy and being in place for the subsequent re-joining (see Figure
5.15). In one commercially available system, a linearised vector is supplied with
Vaccinia virus topoisomerase I covalently attached to phosphate groups at the
3H ends. When the prepared vector is mixed with the DNA fragment to be
cloned, the enzyme transfers the phosphate linkages to the 5H ends of the
fragment, thus joining the insert to the vector. Since the topoisomerase is
already attached to the vector, the reaction only requires two molecules (the
vector and the insert) to come into contact, and is therefore quicker than
conventional ligation which needs simultaneous contact between three molecules (vector, insert, and ligase).
Note that, unlike the action of DNA ligase, the insert in topoisomerase
ligation should not have a 5H -phosphate group. This system is mainly applied
to the cloning of PCR products (Chapter 9), where the 5H end (derived from the
primers used in amplification) is not normally phosphorylated, unless you
specifically order a 5H -phosphorylated primer.

SUMMARY

63

As mentioned above, PCR products often have a single unpaired A residue
added at the 3H end. Some of the topoisomerase vectors are designed to be
compatible with such a product, as the topoisomerase is covalently attached to
an unpaired 3H -T residue; the 3H -A on the PCR product will then pair with this T,
enhancing the efficiency of the reaction.
Other enzyme systems are available for concerted breakage and rejoining of
DNA strands allowing, for example, a one-step transfer of a cloned gene from
one plasmid to another. One example is the site-specific recombinase of bacteriophage lambda (the natural role of which is to insert lambda DNA into the
bacterial chromosome, see Chapter 6). A second example is the Cre-lox system
from the P1 bacteriophage. Cre is a highly site-specific recombinase, which will
act only on the specific sequence known as the lox site. In both cases the
enzyme will carry out recombination between two plasmids carrying the appropriate recognition sequences, leading to transfer of a cloned gene between
two plasmids, or fusion of the plasmids.

5.7 Summary
In this chapter we have seen how restriction endonucleases can be used to cut
DNA, how ligase can be used to join fragments together, and some of the ways
in which these processes can be manipulated to improve the efficiency and
versatility of the process. In the next chapter, we will look at the nature of the
vectors into which the required fragment can be inserted, and how the resulting
DNA can be introduced into a bacterial cell.

6 Vectors
In the previous chapter, we looked at the ways in which a potential insert can
be ligated with a vector molecule, to enable that insert DNA to be replicated
after insertion into a bacterial cell. We now need to consider further the nature
of the vectors that can be used. Once again, we will initially be concentrating on
the vectors that are used for cloning in bacteria ( principally E. coli), and
subsequently looking at the vectors needed for cloning in eukaryotes.

6.1 Plasmid Vectors
6.1.1 Properties of plasmid vectors
Plasmids are by far the most widely used, versatile, and easily manipulated
vectors. They are the work-horses of the molecular biology laboratory. They
are naturally occurring extrachromosomal DNA molecules, usually circular,
double-stranded and supercoiled. Plasmids occur widely in nature, and are
found in most bacterial species. They vary considerably in size, from a few
thousand base pairs up to several hundred kilobases, although plasmids used
as gene cloning vectors are usually small (typically 2±5 kb). Most of the
commonly used ones are based on (or are closely related to) a naturally
occurring E. coli plasmid called ColE1. Later in this chapter we will look at
other types of vectors such as bacteriophages.
The most notorious property of plasmids lies in their ability to disseminate
antibiotic resistance genes. They are responsible to a large extent for the spread
of antibiotic resistance ± although it should be noted that the plasmids used for
gene cloning are nearly always unable to spread from one bacterium to another, and there are restrictions on experimental protocols to ensure that these
experiments do not add new antibiotic resistance genes to clinically important
pathogenic bacteria. Antibiotic resistance is not the limit of the ability of
plasmids, nor the reason for their existence. Interest tends to focus on antibiotic resistance because of its importance in medical microbiology, and because
of the ease with which resistance genes can be isolated and studied. However,
many naturally occurring plasmids code for other properties, or even for none

66

VECTORS

at all, or at least none that we can discern. Plasmids exist because they can
replicate within bacteria, and sometimes spread from one bacterium to another. That is all. They are a form of DNA parasite. Any advantage they confer
on the host bacterium is a bonus that helps the plasmid to survive.

Plasmid replication
In genetic engineering, we make use of this ability of plasmids to be replicated,
as it enables us to insert pieces of DNA which are then copied as part of the
plasmid, and hence passed on to the progeny when the cell replicates. The most
fundamental property of a plasmid, whether we are considering it as a cloning
vector or as a natural phenomenon, is therefore the ability to replicate in the
host bacterium. Most, or all, of the enzymes and other products needed for this
replication are already present in the host cell; the amount of information that
the plasmid has to supply may be only a few hundred base pairs. This region
of the plasmid that is necessary for replication is generally referred to as the
origin of replication, although literally the origin, or the site at which replication starts, is one specific base.
Plasmids that use the origin of replication from ColE1 or its relatives are
multi-copy plasmids. Wild-type ColE1 is present at about 15 copies per cell,
while most of the engineered vectors used today are present in numbers
running into many hundreds of copies per cell. This is convenient in some
ways as it makes it easier to purify large amounts of the plasmid, and if you
want to express a cloned gene you also get a gene dosage effect. The presence of
so many copies of the gene in the cell is reflected in higher levels of the product
of that gene (see also Chapter 15). However, this can also be a disadvantage.
Even without expression of the cloned gene, the large amount of plasmid DNA
may make the cell grow more slowly. If the gene or its product is in any way
harmful to the bacterium, it can sometimes be very difficult to isolate the
required clone. For some specific purposes therefore it is desirable to use
alternative vectors that exist at low copy number (or to use different vectors
altogether that do not require continued viability of the cell, such as some types
of bacteriophage vector ± see below).
Some plasmids are able to replicate in a wide variety of bacterial species
(broad host-range plasmids), but most of those that are used for gene cloning
are rather more restricted in their host range. In one way this is useful: if there is
any question about potential health hazards or environmental consequences
associated with cloning a specific fragment of DNA, then using a narrow hostrange plasmid makes it very unlikely that the gene will be transmitted to other
organisms.
On the other hand, you may wish to carry out genetic manipulations in a
bacterium other than E. coli, especially if your interest lies in studying the

6.1

PLASMID VECTORS

67

behaviour of specific bacteria rather than simply using them to clone pieces of
DNA. It will then usually be necessary to isolate or construct new vector
plasmids, based on a replication origin that is functional in your chosen species.
The host range of your new vector will probably also be limited, and it may well
be unable to replicate in E. coli. This is a disadvantage, because you are likely
to want to use E. coli as an intermediate host for the initial cloning and for
studying the structure and behaviour of the gene that you have cloned. However, it is possible to insert two origins of replication into your plasmid, so that
it will be replicated in E. coli using one origin, and in your chosen host using the
alternative replication origin. Such a vector is known as a shuttle plasmid,
because it can be transferred back and forth between the two species. We can
also use shuttle vectors to transfer cloned genes between E. coli and a eukaryotic organism. We will be coming across various applications of shuttle vectors
in subsequent chapters.
Therefore, the first essential characteristic of a plasmid cloning vector is the
origin of replication, usually designated as ori in plasmid maps.

Cloning sites
The second characteristic that is necessary for a plasmid to be useful as a
cloning vector is a cloning site. This is a unique restriction site, so that the
enzyme concerned will cut the plasmid once only. If a circular molecule is
broken at one position, it is converted into a linear molecule, and it is relatively
simple to join the ends together to reform an intact circle. If an enzyme cuts
more than once, the plasmid will be cut into two or more pieces, and joining
them up again to make an intact plasmid will be much more complicated. A
basic plasmid used as a cloning vector may contain only one or two such
unique restriction sites, which must of course be located in a region of the
plasmid that is not essential for replication or any other functions that we need.
With such a plasmid you are limited not only in your choice of restriction
fragments that can be inserted and in the position of insertion, but also in the
number of different fragments that can be inserted. This is because in most
cases ligation of two restriction fragments, generated with the same enzyme,
recreates the original restriction site. Thus when you insert say a BamHI
fragment into a site on the vector that has been cut with BamHI, the resulting
recombinant plasmid will have two BamHI sites: one at each end of the inserted
fragment (see Figure 6.1). This is the basis of a common test for the presence of
such an insert. Digesting the supposed recombinant plasmid with, in this case,
BamHI will release a DNA fragment that should be the size of the insert you
are trying to clone ± see Chapter 8. However, since the recombinant plasmid
now has two BamHI sites, it would be difficult to clone further BamHI
fragments into it.

The problem here is that in many cases we do want to insert several
fragments into the same plasmid. We may want to combine the expression
signals of one gene with the coding region of another, or we may want to insert
additional markers that can be used to identify the presence of the plasmid.
Or we may, as described above, want to insert the replication origin from
another plasmid so as to create a shuttle vector, and still leave sites available
for further inserts. The best way around this problem is to create a multiple
cloning site (MCS), i.e. a short DNA region that contains recognition sites for a
number of different enzymes. This is done by synthesizing a short piece of
DNA with the required restriction sites, and inserting that into the plasmid in
the usual way. Figure 6.2 shows the structure of pUC18, one of a family of
similar plasmids that are commonly used as cloning vectors, and you will see

that pUC18 contains such a multiple cloning site. Insertion of a fragment into

Selectable markers
So we have a plasmid with a replication origin and one or more restriction sites.
One further feature is essential for a functionally useful vector, and that is a
selectable marker. The need for this arises from the inefficiency both of ligation
and of bacterial transformation. Even with the high efficiency systems that are
now available for E. coli, the best yield available, using native plasmid DNA,
implies that only about 1 per cent of the bacterial cells actually take up the
DNA. In practice the yields are likely to be lower than this ± and if you are
using a host other than E. coli, many orders of magnitude lower. Therefore in
order to be able to recover the transformed clones, it is necessary to be able to
prevent the non-transformed cells (i.e. those cells that have not taken up the
plasmid) from growing. The presence of an antibiotic resistance gene on the
plasmid vector means that you can simply plate out the transformation mix on
an agar plate containing the relevant antibiotic, and only the transformants
will be able to grow. In Figure 6.2, you will see that pUC18 carries a
b-lactamase gene (bla), coding for an enzyme that hydrolyses b-lactam (penicillin-like) antibiotics such as ampicillin (and hence often referred to as AmpR ,
for ampicillin resistance).

Insertional inactivation
In Figure 6.3 you will see a further feature of pUC18. The multiple cloning site
is located near to the 5H end of a b-galactosidase gene (lacZ). The synthetic
oligonucleotide that creates the multiple cloning site was designed so that it did
not affect the reading frame of the lacZ gene; it merely results in the production
of b-galactosidase with some additional amino acids near to the amino terminus of the protein. This does not affect the function of the enzyme; it is still
able to hydrolyse lactose. More accurately, we should say that pUC18 carries a
part of the lacZ gene; we use E. coli strains that carry the remainder of the gene.
The product of the host gene is unable to hydrolyse lactose by itself, and so the
host strain without the plasmid is LacÀ , i.e. it does not ferment lactose. When
pUC18 is inserted into the host, the plasmid-encoded polypeptide will associate
with the host product to form a functional enzyme. We say that pUC18 is
capable of complementing the host defect in lacZ.
We can easily detect the activity of the b-galactosidase by plating the
organism onto agar containing the chromogenic substrate 5-bromo-4-chloro3-indolyl-b-D-galactopyranoside (universally known as X-gal), together with
the inducing agent isopropyl thiogalactoside (IPTG). The X-gal substrate is
colourless but the action of b-galactosidase releases the dye moiety,
resulting in a deep blue colour. Colonies carrying pUC18 are therefore blue

6.1

PLASMID VECTORS

71

when grown on this medium. However, if we are successful in inserting a DNA
fragment at the cloning site, the gene will (normally) be disrupted and the
resulting E. coli colonies are referred to as `white'. The advantage of this
insertional inactivation is that we can tell not only that the cells have been
transformed with the plasmid (since they are able to grow in the presence of
ampicillin), but also that the plasmid is a recombinant, and not merely the
original pUC18 self-ligated. An insertional inactivation marker such as this is
not an essential feature of a cloning vector but it does provide a useful way of
monitoring the success of the ligation strategy and overcoming some of the
problems referred to in the previous chapter.
One word of caution: if the insert is relatively small, and if it happens to
consist of a multiple of three bases, transcription and translation of the lacZ
gene may still occur and the enzyme may still have enough activity (despite the
addition of still more amino acids at the N terminus) to produce a detectable
blue colour. Conversely, a white colony is not a guarantee of cloning success as
the deletion of even a single base at the cloning site, or the insertion of
undesirable junk fragments (in other than multiples of three bases), will put
the lacZ gene in the wrong reading frame and thus inactivate it.
The advantage of plasmid vectors, compared with the other vectors described subsequently in this chapter, is that they are small and easy to manipulate; also they are conceptually simple and universal. You can make and use
plasmid vectors for a wide range of organisms without a detailed knowledge of
the molecular biology of the host or the vector. On the other hand, the basic
plasmid vectors that we have been considering so far are limited in their cloning
capacity, i.e. the size of the insert they can accommodate. Later in this chapter,
we will look at other vectors that will accommodate larger inserts, but first we
need to consider the ways in which we can introduce the recombinant plasmids
into host bacterial cells.

6.1.2 Transformation
Bacterial transformation was discovered in 1928 with the demonstration by
Fred Griffith that cultures of the pneumococcus (Streptococcus pneumoniae)
that had lost virulence could have their pathogenicity restored by addition of
an extract of a killed virulent strain. It was the identification, many years later
(by Avery, MacLeod and McCarty), that the `transforming principle' is DNA
that resolved the question of the chemical nature of the genetic material.
This experiment rests on the natural ability of the pneumococcus to take up
`naked' DNA from its surroundings. This ability is known as competence.
Competence develops naturally in some bacterial species, but although the
range of species that exhibit natural competence is much wider than was
thought for many years to be the case, it is still too limited in scope (or too

72

VECTORS

inefficient or too selective) to be of much use for genetic engineering. In
particular, E. coli does not seem to exhibit natural competence. It was therefore
necessary to develop alternative ways of introducing plasmid DNA into bacterial cells. Although these methods are radically different, they are still referred to as transformation, which is defined as the uptake of naked DNA, to
distinguish it from other methods of horizontal gene transfer, namely conjugation (direct transfer by cell to cell contact) and transduction (which is mediated
by bacteriophage infection).
The breakthrough came with the demonstration that competence in E. coli
cells could be induced by washing them with ice-cold calcium chloride,
followed by adding the plasmid DNA and subjecting the mixture to a brief,
mild heat shock (e.g. 2 min at 428C). It is then necessary to dilute the cells in
growth medium and incubate for a while (30±60 min) to allow the bacteria to
recover and to express the resistance marker introduced on the plasmid, before
plating them onto a selective medium containing the appropriate antibiotic.
Although this simple basic process represented a major, and essential, step
forward, it was very inefficient with yields of perhaps 104 transformants per mg
of pure, supercoiled plasmid DNA (and less with ligation mixtures or nonsupercoiled DNA). Gradually, over the years, improvements have been made
in the transformation process, both by modifying the preparation of competent
cells (e.g. using salts other than calcium chloride) and also by selecting E. coli
strains with mutations that make them easier to transform. With the best of
these systems it is now possible to obtain transformation frequencies in excess
of 109 transformants per mg of plasmid DNA. Where such high yields are
required, it is cost-effective to purchase pre-prepared competent cells of a strain
with high transformation efficiency. Note that although transformation frequencies are generally quoted in these terms (number of transformants per mg
of DNA), there is not a linear relationship between the number of transformants and the amount of DNA used. Transformation works best with low
levels of DNA, and the efficiency with which bacterial cells take up DNA falls
off as the concentration of DNA is increased. If you increase the amount of
DNA too much, you might even decrease not just the efficiency but the actual
numbers of transformants.
Reference back to the discussion of ligation in Chapter 5 will disclose a
quandary here. Ligation works best with high concentrations of DNA. The
following step, transformation, works best with small amounts of DNA.
The resolution is clear, although unpalatable: use only a small proportion of
your ligation mix in the transformation step. If you really need very large
numbers of transformants, scaling up the transformation step does not work
very well ± it is usually much better to carry out several separate small-scale
transformations.
Transformation based on induced competence and heat shock can be used
for bacterial species other than E. coli, but you immediately lose all the

6.2

VECTORS BASED ON THE LAMBDA BACTERIOPHAGE

73

advantages that have been gained by optimization of transformation conditions for selected strains of E. coli. At best, therefore, transformation is likely to
be very inefficient ± and in most cases simply using an E. coli procedure will not
work at all. Therefore laboratories that are interested in manipulating other
bacterial species have had to develop alternative methods of transformation.
Electroporation is the most versatile transformation procedure. Bacterial
cells, washed with water to remove electrolytes from the growth medium, are
mixed with DNA and subjected to a brief pulse of high-voltage electricity. This
appears to induce temporary holes in the cell envelope through which the DNA
can enter. The cells are then diluted into a recovery medium before plating on a
selective medium in the same way as above. Although it is comparatively easy
to obtain some transformants with a wide range of bacteria (or other cells),
there are many parameters that need to be adjusted to obtain optimum performance, including the conditions under which the cells are grown, the temperature of the suspension, and the duration and voltage of the electric pulse.
Since the added DNA seems to simply diffuse through the holes created
(briefly) by the electric pulse, the effect is not specific for DNA; other substances, notably RNA or proteins, can also be introduced into bacterial cells by
electroporation. Nor is it directionally specific. Material within the cell can
diffuse out as well, and the procedure has been used for isolating plasmid DNA
from bacterial cells. It follows from this that, since the plasmid that comes out
of one cell can enter another one, electroporation can be used to transfer
plasmids from one strain to another, simply by applying it to a mixture of
the two strains.
Other methods that are used more commonly with animal and plant cells,
including microinjection, biolistics, and protoplast transformation are considered in Chapter 17.

6.2 Vectors Based on the Lambda
Bacteriophage
6.2.1 Lambda biology
Plasmid vectors are at their best when cloning relatively small fragments of
DNA. Although there is probably no fixed limit to the size of a DNA fragment
that can be inserted into a plasmid, the recombinant plasmid may become
rather less stable with larger DNA inserts, the efficiency of transformation is
reduced, and the plasmid will give a much smaller yield when grown and
purified in E coli. Vectors based on bacteriophage lambda allow efficient
cloning of larger fragments, which is important in constructing gene libraries.
The larger the inserts, the fewer clones you have to screen to find the one you

want (see Chapters 7 and 8). Lambda vectors also have advantages in gene
library construction, as it is much easier to screen large libraries when using
bacteriophage vectors; the results with bacteriophage plaques are much cleaner
than those obtained with bacterial colonies.
In order to understand the nature and use of lambda cloning vectors, some
knowledge of the basic biology of bacteriophage lambda is necessary. While we
hope you are familiar with this, a recap of the salient features (summarized in
Figure 6.4) will be useful.

Lysogeny
Lambda is a temperate bacteriophage, i.e. on infection of E. coli it may enter a
productive lytic cycle, resulting in lysis of the cell and liberation of a number of
phage particles, or it may enter a more or less stable relationship with the host
known as lysogeny. In the lysogenic state, expression of almost all of the phage
genes is switched off by the action of a phage-encoded repressor protein, the
product of the cI gene. The expression of this gene during the establishment of

6.2

VECTORS BASED ON THE LAMBDA BACTERIOPHAGE

75

lysogeny requires two other genes, cII and cIII. The proportion of infected cells
going down each route is influenced by environmental conditions, as well as by
the genetic composition of the phage and the host. Some phage mutants will
only produce lytic infection, and these give rise to clear plaques, while the wildtype phage produces turbid plaques due to the presence of lysogens which are
resistant to further attack by lambda phage (known as superinfection immunity). On the other hand, some bacterial host strains carrying a mutation known
as hfl (high frequency of lysogenization) produce a much higher proportion of
lysogens when infected with wild-type lambda ± which can be useful if we want
a more stably altered host strain, for example if we are studying the expression
of genes carried by the phage. Generally, when using lambda vectors we are
more interested in the recombinant phage carrying the cloned genes, and the
lytic cycle is the more relevant one in such cases.
Although the lysogenic state is relatively stable, that stability is not absolute.
A culture of a bacterial lysogen will normally contain phage particles in the
supernatant, due to a low level of spontaneous failure of the repression mechanism. This rate of breakdown of repression can be increased by treating the
culture with agents that damage the DNA, such as UV irradiation; the DNA
damage induces the production of repair enzymes which amongst other things
destroy the cI repressor protein, allowing initiation of the lytic cycle. Some
widely used lambda vectors carry a mutation in the cI gene which makes the
protein more temperature-sensitive (cI857 mutation). A lysogen carrying such
a mutant phage can be grown as a lysogen at a reduced temperature and the
lytic cycle will be induced by raising the temperature, due to inactivation of the
repressor protein.
In the lysogenic state, lambda is normally integrated into the bacterial
chromosome, by site-specific recombination at a specific position, and is
therefore replicated as part of the bacterial DNA. Induction of the lysogen
requires excision from the chromosome. However, this integration, although
common amongst temperate phages, is not an essential feature of lysogeny.
Lambda can continue to replicate in an extrachromosomal, plasmid-like state;
with some bacteriophages (including P1, which we will encounter later in this
chapter) this is the normal mode of replication in lysogeny.
Particles of wild-type bacteriophage lambda have a double-stranded linear
DNA genome of 48 514 base pairs, in which the 12 bases at each end are
unpaired but complementary (see Figure 6.5). These ends are therefore `sticky'
or `cohesive', much like the ends of many restriction fragments ± but the longer
length of these sticky ends makes the pairing much more stable, even at 378C.
The ends can be separated by heating lambda DNA, and if it is then cooled
rapidly you will get linear monomeric lambda DNA. At low temperatures, the
ends of the molecule will move slowly, and therefore the re-annealing of the
sticky ends will take a long time. Eventually, however, it will resume a circular
(although not covalently joined) structure. When lambda infects a bacterial cell

Cohesive ends:
annealing produces a
circular structure

and injects its DNA into the cell, it will therefore form a circular structure, with
the nicks being repaired in vivo by bacterial DNA ligase. At about this time, a
complex series of events occur that affect subsequent gene expression, determining whether the phage enters the lytic cycle or establishes lysogeny. We do
not need to consider the details of the lytic±lysogenic decision, except to
emphasize that it is essentially irreversible so that once started on one or the
other route, the phage is committed to that process. However, we do need to
consider the events in the lytic cycle.

Lytic cycle
In the lytic cycle, this circular DNA structure is initially replicated, in a
plasmid-like manner (theta replication), to produce more circular DNA. Eventually, however, replication switches to an alternative mode (rolling-circle
replication) which generates a long linear DNA molecule containing a large
number of copies of the lambda genome joined end to end in a continuous
structure (see Figure 6.6). While all this is going on, the genes carried by the
phage are being expressed to produce the components of the phage particle.
These proteins are assembled first of all into two separate structures: the head
(as an empty precursor structure into which the DNA will be inserted), and the
tail (which will be joined to the head after the DNA has been packaged).
The packaging process involves enzymes recognizing specific sites on the
multiple-length DNA molecule generated by rolling-circle replication, and
making asymmetric cuts in the DNA at these positions. These staggered breaks
in the DNA give rise to the cohesive ends seen in the mature phage DNA; these
sites are known as cohesive end sites (cos sites). Accompanying these cleavages,
the region of DNA between two cos sites ± representing a unit length of the
lambda genome ± is wound tightly into the phage head. This process is known

as packaging. Following successful packaging of the DNA into the phage head,
the tail is added to produce the mature phage particle, which is eventually
released when the cell lyses.
Lysis of the bacterial cell is accomplished largely through the action of a
phage-encoded protein, the product of gene S. Mutations in this gene can cause
a delay or failure of lysis ± which can be advantageous in increasing the yield of
bacteriophages, as the replication of the phage will therefore continue for a
longer time instead of being interrupted by lysis of the host cell. Many lambda
vectors have such a mutation.
One of the most important features of this process from our point of view is
that the length of DNA that will be packaged into the phage head is determined
by the distance between two cos sites. If we insert a piece of DNA into our
lambda vector, we will increase that distance, and so the amount of DNA to be

78

VECTORS

packaged will be bigger. However, the head is a fixed size, and can only
accommodate a certain amount of DNA. It can take somewhat more than is
present in wild-type lambda (up to about 51 kb altogether, which is about 5 per
cent more than wild-type). As one of the reasons for using lambda is to be able
to clone large pieces of DNA, this would be a serious limitation. The way
round it is to delete some of the DNA that is normally present. This is possible,
because the lambda genome contains a number of genes that are not absolutely
necessary ± especially if we only need lytic growth, when we can delete any
genes that are solely required for the establishment of lysogeny. However, we
cannot delete too much. The stability of the phage head requires a certain
amount of DNA so, even though there are more genes that are not required, we
cannot delete all that DNA. To produce viable phage, there has to be a
minimum of 37 kb of DNA (about 75 per cent of wild-type) between the two
cos sites that are cleaved.
The existence of these packaging limits is a very important feature of the
design and application of lambda vectors, and also of cosmids which we will
discuss later.

6.2.2 In vitro packaging
Naked bacteriophage DNA can be introduced into a host bacterial cell by
transformation (often referred to as transfection when talking about phage
DNA), in much the same way as we described for a plasmid. The big difference
is that in this case instead of plating on a selective agar and counting bacterial
colonies, we would mix the transfection mix with a culture of a phage-sensitive
indicator bacterium in molten soft agar and look for plaques (zones of clearing
due to lysis of the bacteria) when overlaid onto an agar plate. Note that in this
case we do not need an antibiotic resistance gene as a selective marker.
However, the large size of most bacteriophage DNA molecules, including
that of lambda, makes transfection an inefficient process compared with
plasmid transformation, and not suitable for the generation of gene libraries
which is the principal application of lambda vectors. However, there is a more
efficient alternative. Some mutant lambda phages, in an appropriate bacterial
host strain, will produce empty phage heads (as they lack a protein needed for
packaging the DNA), while others are defective in the production of the head,
but contain the proteins needed for packaging. The two extracts are thus
complementary to one another. Use of the mixture allows productive packaging of added DNA, which occurs very effectively in vitro (including
the addition of the tails). The resulting phage particles can then be assayed
by addition of a sensitive bacterial culture and plating as an overlay, as above.
Since in vitro packaging of lambda DNA is much more effective than transfection, it is the method that is almost always used.

6.2

79

VECTORS BASED ON THE LAMBDA BACTERIOPHAGE

One feature of this system that is markedly different from working with
plasmid vectors is that the packaging reaction is most efficient with multiplelength DNA. The enzyme involved in packaging the DNA normally cuts the
DNA at two different cos sites on a multiple-length molecule; monomeric
circular molecules with a single cos site are packaged very poorly. So whereas
with plasmid vectors the ideal ligation product is a monomeric circular plasmid
consisting of one copy of the vector plus insert, for lambda vectors it is advantageous to adjust the ligation conditions so that we do get multiple end-to-end
ligation of lambda molecules together with the insert fragments. The stickiness
of the ends of the linear lambda DNA means this happens very readily.

6.2.3 Insertion vectors
The simplest form of lambda vectors is that known as an insertion vector. These
are similar in concept to a plasmid vector, in that they contain a single cloning
site into which DNA can be inserted. However, wild-type lambda DNA contains many sites for most of the commonly used restriction enzymes; you cannot
just cut it with say HindIII and ligate it with your insert DNA. HindIII has seven
sites in normal lambda DNA, and so will cut it into eight pieces. (Note the
difference between a circular DNA molecule such as a plasmid, and a linear
molecule like lambda: cut a circular DNA molecule once and you still have one
fragment; cut linear DNA once and you have two fragments.) It would be
almost impossible to join all these fragments (and your insert) together in the
right order. To circumvent this, all lambda vectors have been genetically manipulated to remove unwanted restriction sites. In some cases this has been done
by deleting regions of DNA carrying these sites (and hence also increasing the
cloning capacity); another strategy is to select mutants with alterations in their
sequence that result in the loss of the unwanted restriction sites.
In Figure 6.7, we see one example of a lambda vector, known as lambda
gt10. In this vector, there is only a single site at which EcoRI will cut the DNA.
The deletions and other manipulations that this phage has undergone have
removed some of the unwanted sites, and have also reduced the overall size of
the phage DNA to 43.3 kb (which is still large enough to produce viable phage
particles, and still contains the genes that are needed for viability), and hence
allows the insertion of foreign DNA up to a maximum of 7.6 kb.

VECTORS

Cutting this vector with EcoRI will produce two DNA fragments, referred to
as the left and right arms. Although it therefore appears that the insert would
have to be ligated to two different pieces of DNA, in practice this does not
complicate the ligation as much as might be imagined. One end of each of the
two fragments is derived from the cohesive ends of the lambda DNA, and will
therefore anneal quite stably at 378C ± so although not covalently joined they
can be considered as a single DNA fragment.
Lambda gt10 also provides us with another example of how insertional
inactivation can be used to distinguish the parental vector (which may form
by religation of the arms without an insert) from the recombinants. The EcoRI
site is found within the repressor (cI) gene, so the recombinant phage, which
carry an insert in this position, are unable to make functional repressor. As a
consequence, they will be unable to establish lysogeny and will give rise to clear
plaques, whereas the parental gt10 phage will give rise to turbid plaques. The
distinction can be made even more marked, by using a host strain carrying the
hfl (high frequency of lysogenization) mutation. In such a strain, any parental
phage will establish lysogeny extremely efficiently, rather than entering the lytic
cycle, with the result that few, if any, plaques will be obtained. This does not
affect the recombinants, which are unable to make functional repressor, and
therefore do not establish lysogeny. So you can achieve substantial enrichment
of recombinant phage over the religated vector without having to resort to
dephosphorylation with alkaline phosphatase.
Another example of a lambda insertion vector, lambda gt11, is used in a
rather different way. Since it allows expression of the cloned fragment, it is
considered later in this chapter, together with other expression vectors.
The packaging limits for lambda DNA are between 37 kb and 51 kb, as
described above. In other words, we cannot make an insertion vector smaller
than 37 kb, or we will be unable to grow it to produce the DNA that we need.
Also, we cannot insert a DNA fragment so big that it would make the product
larger than 51 kb; the recombinant DNA would be unable to be packaged into
the phage heads. It follows from this that the maximum cloning capacity for an
insertion vector is (51 minus 37) kb  14 kb. This is larger than we would
normally clone comfortably in a plasmid vector, but still smaller than we
would like for some purposes. In order to increase the available cloning capacity, we have to turn to a different type of lambda vector, known as a
replacement vector.

6.2.4 Replacement vectors
The packaging limits that restrict the cloning capacity of insertion vectors are
imposed by the physical requirements of the phage head rather than by the
nature of the genes needed. There are more genes that are not essential for lytic

6.2

81

VECTORS BASED ON THE LAMBDA BACTERIOPHAGE

growth and could be deleted, except that it would make the phage DNA too
small to produce viable progeny. That provides a clue to an alternative design
of lambda cloning vectors. Instead of merely inserting extra DNA, arrange the
vector so that a piece of DNA can be removed and replaced by your insert ±
hence the term replacement vector.
Figure 6.8 shows an example of a lambda replacement vector, EMBL4.
Instead of being cut just once by the restriction enzyme of choice (in this case
BamHI), there are two sites where the DNA will be cleaved. The vector DNA
will therefore be cut into three fragments: the left and right arms (which will
anneal by virtue of their cohesive ends) and a third fragment which is not
needed (except to maintain the size of the DNA) and can be discarded. Since
the only purpose of this fragment is to help to fill up the phage head it is known
as a stuffer fragment.
In use, therefore, this vector would be cut with BamHI and the fragments
separated, e.g. by gel electrophoresis. The stuffer fragment would be thrown
away, and the arms mixed with the restriction fragments to be cloned. These
could be generated by BamHI digestion, or by cleavage of the target with
another enzyme that produces compatible ends, e.g. Sau3A (see Chapter 5).
Ligation of the mixture would produce recombinant phage DNA that would be
packaged into phage heads by in vitro packaging. The cloning capacity of the
vector is thus considerably increased; in this case the size of the arms combined
comes to 29 kb and thus you can clone fragments up to (51 minus 29) kb  22 kb.

There is a further advantage to such a vector. The combined size of the arms
is only 29 kb, which is less than the minimum required for packaging. Any pairs
of arms that are ligated without an insert will therefore be too small to produce
viable phage particles. Such viable particles will only be produced if ligation
results in an insert of at least (37±29) kb  8 kb. The vector thus provides a
positive selection for recombinants as opposed to parental phage, and furthermore for recombinants that contain an insert of at least 8 kb. The gene library
will therefore be free of non-recombinant phage.
In Chapter 5 we discussed strategies, with plasmid vectors, for ensuring that
we obtained recombinant progeny rather than parental vector molecules,
including the use of alkaline phosphatase treatment of the vector to prevent
recircularization. This is not necessary with replacement vectors. Since we do
not have to treat the vector with phosphatase, we have another possibility ±
dephosphorylation of the insert. In the production of a gene library, the
insertion of more than one fragment into the same vector molecule is a problem
that can give rise to anomalies in characterizing the insert in relation to the
genome it came from. Phosphatase treatment of the insert will prevent insert±
insert ligation, and hence will ensure that all of the recombinants carry only a
single insert fragment.
There is yet another useful feature that can be built into a replacement
vector. Since the stuffer fragment is not necessary for phage production
(apart from filling up the phage head), it does not have to be lambda
DNA. It can be anything we want, so we could for example put in a fragment
carrying a b-galactosidase gene. Then any plaques formed by phage that still
carry the stuffer fragment would be blue (on a medium containing X-gal). Of
course ideally there should not be any; but there may be some phage DNA
molecules that have not been cut completely, or there may be some stuffer
DNA contaminating the preparation of the vector arms, which could then be
ligated back into the vector. Any plaques containing the stuffer will be blue ±
so you have an immediate check that everything has gone according to plan,
or not.
So we see that lambda vectors provide a highly versatile and efficient system
for primary cloning of unknown fragments, especially in the construction of
genomic and cDNA libraries (see Chapter 7). They extend the cloning capacity
over that readily obtainable with plasmid vectors, and can easily generate the
very large numbers of recombinants that are required for a gene library.
However, some people do not like working with lambda systems, mainly
because it requires a different set of techniques for growing, assaying and
maintaining phage preparations. There is nothing really difficult about it; it
is just unfamiliar. The only real disadvantage to lambda cloning systems is the
size of the vector DNA. With an insertion vector, your recombinant may
contain 5 kb of insert and 45 kb of vector. This makes it more difficult to
analyse or manipulate your insert than would be the case with a plasmid

6.3

83

COSMIDS

recombinant ± especially as the lambda vector will contain a substantial
number of recognition sites for different restriction enzymes. The normal
procedure therefore, having identified the recombinant clone of interest,
would be to reclone the insert (or part of it) into a plasmid vector for further
analysis and manipulation.
Although lambda phages are the most widely used phage vectors, there are
other phages, or vectors based on them, that are used for specific purposes,
including P1 and M13. These are discussed further in subsequent sections in
this chapter; but first we need to look at a special class of vector that combines
some of the features of lambda and plasmid vectors, and enables the cloning of
even larger pieces of DNA. These are the cosmids.

6.3 Cosmids
The lambda packaging reaction has two fundamental requirements: the presence of a cos site, and the physical size of the DNA. Cosmids exploit this to
provide cloning vectors with a capacity larger than can be achieved with
lambda replacement vectors.
Basically, a cosmid is simply a plasmid which contains a cos site. As with all
plasmid vectors, it has an origin of replication, a selectable marker (usually an
antibiotic resistance gene), and a cloning site. Digestion, ligation with the
potential insert fragments, and subsequent purification of recombinant clones,
are carried out more or less as for a normal plasmid vector. However, instead
of transforming bacterial cells with the ligation mix, as you would normally
with a plasmid, you subject the ligation mixture to in vitro packaging as
described above for lambda vectors. Since the cosmid carries a cos site, it can
be a substrate for in vitro packaging, but only if it is big enough. The vector
itself is quite small ± in the example shown in Figure 6.9, it is 5.4 kb, which is
much too small for successful packaging. The packaging reaction will only be
successful if you have inserted a DNA fragment between about 32 kb and 45 kb

bla

VECTORS

in size. So you not only have an increased cloning capacity, but also a positive
selection for an insert, and for an insert that is quite large.
There is one difference in the ligation procedure between cosmids and
plasmids. The in vitro packaging reaction requires two separate cos sites and
therefore works best with multimeric structures resembling the normal lambda
DNA substrate. The efficiency of cosmid cloning can therefore be enhanced by
adjusting the ligation conditions to favour multimer formation, or by using
more complex cosmid designs and/or more sophisticated digestion and ligation
strategies that ensure that only multimeric ligation products are made. Note,
however, that although the ligation results in multimeric structures, the in vitro
packaging reaction will ensure that each recombinant clone contains only a
monomeric cosmid.
Of course the products of the packaging reaction, although they are phage
particles, will not give rise to more phages after infection of a host bacterium.
They do not carry any of the genes that are needed for production of more
phage particles, nor for lysis of the cell. So you will not get phage plaques.
However, the cosmid will replicate as a plasmid, and hence will give rise to
more cosmid-containing cells, and these can be selected as colonies on agar
containing an antibiotic (in this case ampicillin).
For very large genomes, such as mammalian ones, the cloning capacity of
cosmids is still rather too small for convenience, and alternative vectors with
even greater capacity are now available (see below). However, for smaller and
medium-sized genomes, cosmids can be extremely valuable. A complete bacterial genome can be covered by a selection of only a few hundred cosmids,
which can be useful in genome mapping and sequencing projects.
Cosmids have some advantages over phage lambda, particularly in that they
can be propagated and purified by conventional plasmid-oriented techniques,
without having to become familiar with phage technology. Furthermore, with
cosmids the vector is small compared with the insert, in contrast to lambda
where more than half of the DNA of a recombinant phage is derived from the
vector. Subcloning of fragments of your insert, to obtain fragments carrying
just the gene you need, is therefore rather easier with cosmids than with lambda
vectors. On the other hand, a lambda library can be easily stored as a pool of
phage particles in a single tube.

6.4 M13 Vectors
Like lambda, M13 is a bacteriophage that infects E. coli. That is about as far as
the resemblance goes, either biologically or in their use as cloning vectors.
M13 is a `sex-specific' bacteriophage, or more accurately F-specific. It
attaches to the tips of the pili that are produced on the surface of bacteria
that carry an F-type plasmid, and is therefore unable to infect bacteria that do

6.4

85

M13 VECTORS

not carry such a plasmid. The very long, thin filamentous phage particles
contain a circular, single-stranded DNA molecule of about 6 kb. After this
DNA enters the cell, it is converted to a double-stranded molecule (the replicative form, RF) by synthesis of the complementary strand. This molecule is
replicated by producing a circular single-stranded copy of one strand of the
RF. This single-stranded DNA is again converted to a double-stranded form
(see Figure 6.10). The production of the single-stranded intermediate requires a
specific signal on the DNA, and is therefore completely strand-specific, i.e. it is
always the same strand that appears in this form. This separation of the
synthesis of the two strands is not unique to M13 but is found in some other
bacteriophages and also some classes of plasmids. However, most of the phage
DNA within the cell is double-stranded circular DNA (RF), and can be
isolated by conventional plasmid purification methods.
Continued replication of the phage DNA leads to a build up of these plasmidlike DNA molecules within the cell. At the same time, expression of phage genes
occurs, and the product of one of these genes binds to the single-stranded

M13 phage DNA

product, initiating production of phage particles. This occurs by extrusion of
the DNA through the cell membrane, during which process it becomes coated
with phage proteins. The length of the filamentous phage particle is determined
by the length of the DNA molecule, unlike lambda where the size of the particle
is determined by the structure of the proteins of which it is composed. Hence,
there are no absolute packaging limits for M13, although the phage does
become increasingly fragile if large DNA fragments are inserted.
A curious, and significant, feature of M13 is that infection does not lead to
bacterial lysis. Phage particles continue to be produced, and the cell remains
viable, although it grows more slowly. Infection does result in the appearance
of `plaques' in a bacterial lawn, but these are zones of reduced growth rather
than zones of lysis. As a consequence of the continuing viability of the host cell,
very high titres of phage can be produced.
The main advantage of M13 is that it provides a very convenient way of
obtaining single-stranded versions of a gene, which would be difficult to do in
any other way. Single-stranded DNA obtained from M13 clones has been
widely used for DNA sequencing (see Chapter 10). Although, nowadays,
double-stranded DNA templates are commonly used for sequencing, singlestranded vectors are still preferred by some laboratories. Another application
where single-stranded DNA can be advantageous (although not essential) is
site-directed mutagenesis (Chapter 15). M13 vectors also have another role, not
connected with the production of single-stranded DNA: this is the technique
known as phage display (see Chapter 14).
Vectors based on M13 have been engineered to contain multiple cloning
sites, and these vectors usually include a beta-galactosidase gene to distinguish
recombinants from parental vector, as was described for pUC18 earlier in this
chapter. DNA fragments can be cloned into such sites, using the plasmid-like
replicative form; after transformation, the progeny are detected by a plaque
assay, with `white' plaques indicating a recombinant clone and blue plaques
(on a medium containing X-gal) suggesting non-recombinant phage. As discussed earlier, in relation to pUC18, some blue plaques may occur through
insertion of small fragments if they do not shift the reading frame of the lacZ
gene.
If you then isolate phage particles from the supernatant of an infected
culture, these will contain your gene in single-stranded form. Note that because
of the specificity of the replication process, it is always the same strand that is
found in all phage particles.

6.5 Expression Vectors
The above discussion has assumed that all you want to do is to clone a piece of
DNA. It does not consider the possibility that you might want to obtain

6.5

EXPRESSION VECTORS

87

expression of the gene encoded by that DNA. If you take a DNA fragment
from another organism and clone it in E. coli, there are many reasons why it
may not be expressed. At the simplest level, these relate to the signals necessary
for initiating transcription (a promoter) and translation (a ribosome-binding
site and start codon). The basic way of encouraging (although not ensuring)
expression of the cloned gene is to incorporate these signals into the vector,
adjacent to the cloning site. This is then known as an expression vector.
Expression vectors are of two main types (see Figures 6.11 and 6.12). If the
vector just carries a promoter, and relies on the translation signals present in the
cloned DNA, it is referred to as a transcriptional fusion vector. On the other
hand, if the vector supplies the translational signals as well (so you are inserting
the cloned fragment into the coding region of a vector gene), then you have a
translational fusion. Note that in this case the insert must be in frame with the
start codon. The plasmid vector pUC18 that we looked at earlier is actually a
translational fusion vector, although not often used as such. A better example is
the lambda vector gt11 (see Figure 6.13). This is an insertional vector, 43.7 kb in
length (making the maximum cloning capacity about 7 kb). It has been engineered to contain a b-galactosidase gene, and has a single EcoRI restriction
site within that gene. This confers two properties on the vector. Firstly, insertion
of DNA at the EcoRI site will inactivate the b-galactosidase gene, so that
recombinants will give `white' plaques on a medium containing X-gal. Secondly, the insert, if in the correct orientation and in frame, will give rise to a

functions associated with your cloned gene ± it contains too much extraneous
material ± but that is not the point. It is reasonably likely to react with some
antibodies to the natural product, which makes it a useful way of detecting the
clone of interest, as we will see in Chapter 8.

EXPRESSION VECTORS

To make full use of an expression vector you need to be able to choose
whether to have expression on or off. The regulation of most inducible bacterial
promoters, such as that of the lac operon, is rather `leaky', i.e. there is still some
expression even in the uninduced or repressed state. Firmer control can be
achieved by the use of promoters from bacteriophages, notably one from the
bacteriophage T7. In T7, this promoter controls the expression of the `late'
genes, i.e. the genes that are only switched on at a late stage of infection. This
promoter is not recognized by E. coli RNA polymerase, but requires the T7
RNA polymerase, a product of genes expressed earlier in the infection cycle. So
if we clone our DNA fragment downstream from a T7 promoter, using an
`ordinary' E. coli host (lacking a T7 polymerase gene) we will get no expression
at all. This can be useful, as the product might be deleterious to the cell. Once we
are satisfied that we have made the right construct, we can isolate the plasmid
and put it into another E. coli strain that has been engineered to contain a T7
polymerase gene, and hence will allow transcription of the cloned gene. If the
expression of the T7 polymerase gene is itself regulated, for example by putting
it under the control of a lac promoter, then we can turn the expression of the T7
polymerase up (by adding IPTG) or down, so we still have control over the level
of expression. Further devices can be included to inhibit the low level of T7
polymerase arising from the leakiness of the uninduced lac promoter.
The pGEM1 series of vectors (see Figure 6.14) provide an example. In
this case, there is a multiple cloning site adjacent to the T7 promoter, so any
DNA inserted will be under the control of the T7 promoter. This is a transcriptional fusion vector, and it is often more useful for generating substantial
amounts of an RNA copy of your cloned fragment, which can then be used
as a probe for hybridization. The vector actually has a second specific promoter, derived from another bacteriophage (SP6), at the other side of the
multiple cloning site, so if you provide an SP6 polymerase you will get an
RNA copy of the other strand, the antisense strand. The usefulness of this will
be apparent when we consider applications of antisense RNA, such as the
RNase protection assay (Chapter 13).

There are also a variety of translational fusion vectors with T7 promoters,
which are designed for obtaining high, controllable, levels of protein expression.
We will return to the concept of expression vectors, and other factors that have
to be considered for the optimization of protein production, in Chapter 15.

6.6 Vectors for Cloning and Expression in
Eukaryotic Cells
Most primary cloning (i.e. the initial isolation of a gene or other DNA fragment from a target organism) is carried out using bacterial hosts (usually E.
coli), because of the ease of manipulation and the range of powerful techniques
that have been developed. Eukaryotic hosts are more commonly used for
studying the behaviour of genes that have already been cloned (but in an
environment more closely related to their original source), for analysing their
effect on the host cell and modifying it, or for obtaining a product which is not
made in its natural state in a bacterial host. There is therefore more emphasis
with eukaryotic vectors in obtaining gene expression rather than making gene
libraries or primary cloning (with the notable exception of YAC vectors, see
below). There is a bewildering variety of vectors available for cloning in
different eukaryotic hosts, and a full review of them is way beyond the scope
of this book. In this chapter, we want to introduce some of the main concepts,
many of which are similar in principle to those of bacterial cloning vectors
although there are significant differences; we will consider further the use of
eukaryotic hosts for product formation in Chapter 15, and the genetic modification of animal and plant cells (or whole animals and plants) in Chapter 17.

6.6.1 Yeasts
Microbiologically, `yeasts' are single-celled fungi, as opposed to filamentous
fungi, but the term is quite imprecise. Not all `yeasts' are related taxonomically,
and indeed some filamentous fungi can also grow in a unicellular form that is
referred to as a yeast form. Although in common usage the term `yeast' would
be taken to mean the brewer's/baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, even
molecular biologists are starting to have to recognize the existence of other
yeasts (especially members of the genus Pichia, which we will encounter again
in Chapter 15). However, for the moment we will limit ourselves to S. cerevisiae.
The vectors that will be most familiar, after reading about bacterial cloning
vectors, are the yeast episomal plasmids (YEp). These are based (Figure 6.15)
on a naturally occurring yeast plasmid known as the 2 mm plasmid, and they
are therefore able to replicate independently in yeast, at a high copy number

(25±100 copies per cell). As is usually the case with vectors for eukaryotic cells,
these plasmids also have an E. coli origin of replication, enabling them to be
grown and manipulated in an E. coli host (i.e. they are shuttle vectors). There is
one point of detail in which they differ from bacterial cloning vectors, and that
is the nature of the selectable marker. For bacterial vectors, we can exploit the
large number of antibacterial antibiotics (and the correspondingly large
number of antibiotic resistance genes) to enable us to select our transformants.
There are fewer antibiotics available to which yeasts are sensitive (although
some fungicides can be used), and therefore selection more commonly makes
use of complementation of auxotrophic mutations in the host strain. For
example, a host strain of S. cerevisiae with a mutation in the trp1 gene will be
unable to grow on a medium lacking tryptophan. If the vector plasmid carries a
functional trp1 gene, then transformants can be selected on a tryptophandeficient medium. Other commonly used selectable markers include ura3
(uracil), leu2 (leucine), and his3 (histidine). These vectors would usually also
carry an antibiotic resistance marker for selection in E. coli.
Vectors that replicate as plasmids in S. cerevisiae are often rather unstable, in
that they tend to be lost from the culture as plasmid-free daughter cells
accumulate. This is due to erratic partitioning during mitosis. Newer versions
of YEp vectors, taking advantage of a better understanding of the biology of
the 2 mm plasmid, are more stable.
Autonomously replicating plasmids can also be constructed by inserting a
specific sequence from a yeast chromosome; this sequence is known, unsurprisingly, as an autonomously replicating sequence, or ars. These plasmids are very
unstable, but some constructs that also include a centromere are more stable
(Figure 6.16). In contrast to the YEp vectors, these yeast centromere plasmids
(YCp), are normally maintained at a low copy number (1±2 copies per cell),
which can be advantageous if your product is in any way harmful to the cell, or
if you want to study its regulation.

Since one of the purposes of using yeast as a host is to express the cloned
gene, these vectors are commonly designed as expression vectors. The principles involved are similar to those described above for bacterial expression
vectors, except that of course the expression signals involved are those applicable to S. cerevisiae rather than E. coli. If required, this can include signals for
secretion, or for targeting to the nucleus or other cellular compartments. Note
that S. cerevisiae, although eukaryotic, has very few introns, and is not the host
of choice if you want to ensure correct excision of introns.
The vectors described are maintained in yeast as circular DNA molecules,
much like a bacterial plasmid. Two other classes of vectors deserve a mention.
First, there are the yeast integrating plasmids (YIp). These do not replicate
independently but integrate into the chromosome by recombination (Figure
6.17). The frequency of transformation is very low, and it is difficult to recover
the recombinant vector after transformation. The main advantage is that the
transformants are much more stable than those obtained with the autonomously replicating plasmids.
Second, there are the yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs), which carry
telomeres that enable their maintenance in S. cerevisiae as linear structures
resembling a chromosome. The use of these vectors, for cloning very large
pieces of DNA, is quite distinct from the uses of the vectors described above.
YACs are considered further, along with other vectors used for the same
purpose, in a later section of this chapter.

6.6.2 Mammalian cells
In bacteria, the cloning vectors used replicate separately from the chromosome,
as plasmids or bacteriophages. As we have seen above, the same is true of many

types of vectors used in yeast. The situation with cloning in mammalian cells is
somewhat different in that independent, plasmid-like, replication is often not
sustained. Some vectors are capable of plasmid-like replication, especially
those carrying the origin of replication from the virus SV40 (simian virus 40),
which replicate episomally in some mammalian cells (such as COS cells). More
stable clones are obtained by inserting the DNA into the chromosome, which
happens readily in mammalian cells. In either case, the cloning vector enables
you to organize your cloned gene in relation to a set of expression signals, many
of which are derived from viruses such as SV40 or cytomegalovirus (CMV).
The general features of such a vector are exemplified in Figure 6.18. A gene
inserted at the multiple cloning site (MCS) enables high level constitutive
expression from the CMV promoter, while the presence of a polyadenylation
signal increases mRNA stability. The SV40 origin allows episomal replication
in COS cells, and the neomycin phosphotransferase gene permits selection for
resistance to the antibiotic G-418 (Geneticin1). Note that this is a shuttle
vector, carrying an E. coli origin of replication and an ampicillin resistance
gene (b-lactamase), so the construction can be carried out in E. coli before

transferring the recombinant plasmid to a mammalian cell line. There is a wide
variety of commercially available expression vectors for mammalian cells, with
more sophisticated features than that shown. We will return to the topic of
expression of cloned genes in mammalian cells in Chapter 15.
There are other types of vector available, based on various viruses, which
can be used to transmit your cloned gene from one cell to another. Of these,
the retroviral vectors deserve a special mention, and in order to understand
these we need a brief account of retroviral biology. Retroviruses have an RNA
genome. When a cell is infected, the RNA is copied into double-stranded
DNA by the action of a viral protein, reverse transcriptase. This protein is
present in the virion and enters the cell along with the RNA. (Reverse
transcriptase is formally an RNA-directed DNA polymerase, and we will
encounter it again in Chapter 7 where we consider its use in the production
of cDNA from mRNA templates.) This DNA then circularizes and is integrated into the host cell DNA by the action of another virion protein known
as integrase. The efficiency of integration of the DNA into the genome is one
of the main attractions of this system for genetic manipulation of animal
cells.
The integrated DNA is bounded by sequences known as long terminal
repeats (LTR) which include a strong promoter for transcription of the integrated viral genes gag, pol and env. Full-length transcripts provide the viral
RNA which is assembled into virus particles; one region of the virus, known as
the psi site, is essential for this process. The packaged virus particles acquire
envelope glycoproteins from the host cell membrane as they bud off from the
cell, without lysis. These glycoproteins determine the type of receptors the virus
uses to infect further cells.

6.6

VECTORS FOR CLONING AND EXPRESSION IN EUKARYOTIC CELLS

Development of vectors based on retroviruses rests on the knowledge that
most of these functions can be provided in trans, e.g. by genes from a defective
helper virus already integrated into the genome of the host cell. The main
features that are cis-acting, and therefore need to be located on the vector itself,
are the LTR sequences and the psi site.
The basic features of the use of such a vector are outlined in Figure 6.19. The
vector is a shuttle plasmid, so E. coli is used for construction of the recombinant plasmid by inserting the required gene at the multiple cloning site. This
construct is then used to transfect a culture of a special cell line (helper cells)
that contains the gag, pol and env genes required for virus production, integrated into the genome. The transfected cells will therefore be able to produce
virus particles containing an RNA copy of your construct. These particles are
able to infect other cells that do not contain the integrated essential genes; since

the viral particles carry preformed reverse transcriptase and integrase, the
RNA will be copied into DNA in such cells, and the DNA will be efficiently
integrated into the genome. However, since these cells do not carry the essential
genes, no further production of viral particles will occur. However, your gene is
now stably integrated into the chromosome and can be expressed from the
adjacent promoter derived from the vector.
The specificity of the viral particles for other cells will be determined by the
envelope gene carried by the helper cells. Replacing that gene by other genes for
envelope glycoproteins from other viruses, in particular the VSV-G gene from
vesicular stomatitis virus, enables a wider range of target cells to be used, not
just mammalian cells but extending to, for example chickens, oysters, toads,
zebrafish, mosquitoes ± in fact cells from virtually all non-mammalian (and
mammalian) species can be infected.
The expression of genes in mammalian cells, and the incorporation of
foreign genes into the genome of whole animals (transgenesis) is considered
further in Chapters 15 and 17 respectively.

6.7 Supervectors: YACs and BACs
Although cosmids were the first vectors that made the production and use of
mammalian gene libraries feasible, their limited capacity would still not have
sufficed for decoding the human genome. This was made possible by the development of novel supervectors that were able to carry 100 kb or more. The first
one of these was the yeast artificial chromosome (YAC). Similarly to cosmids,
these could be constructed through knowledge of what features were necessary
to enable the vector to be carried by its host (in the case of yeast, telomeres, a
centromere, and an origin of replication), as well as selectable markers and
cloning sites (Figure 6.20). As with the shuttle plasmids we have referred to
earlier, the YAC vector is propagated as a circular plasmid in E coli. Restriction
enzyme digestion removes the stuffer fragment between the two telomeres, and
cuts the remaining vector molecule into two linear arms, each carrying a selectable marker. The insert is then ligated between these arms, as in the case of phage
lambda, and transformed into a yeast cell, with selection for complementation of
both auxotrophic markers. This ensures that the recombinants contain both
arms. Furthermore a successful recombinant must contain the tel sequences at
each end, so that the yeast transformant can use these sequences to build
functional telomeres. The titans amongst vectors, YACs are routinely used to
clone 600 kb fragments, and specialized versions are available which can accommodate inserts close to 2 Mb. As such, they will not only easily accommodate
any eukaryotic gene in its entirety, but also complete within their framework of
three-dimensional structure and distant regulatory sequences. They have therefore been very useful in the production of transgenic organisms (see Chapter 17).

However, YACs have problems with the stability of the insert, especially
with very large fragments which can be subject to rearrangement by recombination. Furthermore, apart from the fact that many laboratories are not set up
for the use of yeast vectors, the recombinant molecules are not easy to recover
and purify. Thus, larger bacterial vectors are used more than YACs even
though their capacity is lower. These include vectors based on bacteriophage
P1, which are able to accommodate inserts in excess of 100 kb, and bacterial
artificial chromosomes (BACs), which are based on the F plasmid and can
accommodate 300 kb of insert. These vectors lack the instability problems
found in YACs, and play an important role in genome sequencing projects
(see Chapter 10).

6.8 Summary
Earlier in this chapter we considered the advantage that can be gained in
constructing gene libraries using vectors with higher cloning capacity such as

lambda replacement vectors and cosmids. Even larger fragments can be cloned
by employing other vector systems. For relatively small genomes, such as those
of bacteria, there is not usually a need for such large inserts. If we simply find
out that our gene is somewhere in a 300 kb insert, there is still a lot of work to
do to find out exactly where it is. We might as well go straight to a library in a
lambda replacement vector; with inserts of 15±20 kb, a library of a few thousand clones will provide adequate coverage of a bacterial genome. Screening a
library of this size is quite straightforward. However, libraries of larger fragments are extremely useful for establishing physical maps of the chromosome
and as an adjunct to genome sequencing projects (see Chapter 10).
However, for larger genomes, such as those of mammalian cells, a reasonably complete gene library in a lambda replacement vector would require
hundreds of thousands of clones, and screening then becomes laborious. In
these cases, the use of larger inserts is advantageous, and the use of additional
systems such as yeast artificial chromosomes (YAC vectors) becomes appropriate.

7 Genomic and cDNA Libraries

Gene libraries play a central role in gene cloning strategies, as will be apparent
from the frequent references to them in previous chapters. Why are they so
important? The answer to this question goes back to the basic concept of gene
cloning, as outlined in Chapter 3. If you are trying to isolate a specific gene (or
more generally a specific fragment of the genome), you will break the genome
up into small enough pieces to be cloned using your chosen vector, and then
screen that collection of clones to identify the one that contains the bit of DNA
that you are looking for. (We will consider the ways of doing that in the next
chapter.) You only want that one clone, so you could throw all the rest away;
but then, if you want to clone another piece of DNA from the same source, you
would have to go through the whole process again. So instead of discarding all
the clones you do not want, you can store them away somewhere, pooled
together, so that next time you can just screen the same collection to identify
the clones that carry this other gene. You have made a gene library ± a resource
that can be used to retrieve any of the genes from your starting material. Even if
you do not intend to keep it and re-screen it, you still call it a gene library.
A gene library in these terms is therefore a collection of clones which between
them represent the entire genome of an organism. More specifically, we should
refer to such a library as a genomic library, to distinguish it from a different sort
of gene library which is constructed from DNA copies of the mRNA present in
the originating cells at the time of isolation. These DNA copies of mRNA are
referred to as copy or complementary DNA (cDNA), and hence such a library is
referred to as a cDNA library. In this chapter we will look at the construction of
these two types of libraries; ways of screening them are considered in Chapter 8.

7.1 Genomic Libraries
The first step in producing a genomic library is to fragment the genomic DNA
into pieces of a suitable size for cloning in an appropriate vector. It might be
considered that the simplest way to do this is to digest the DNA to completion
with a restriction endonuclease such as EcoRI, but therein lies a problem. In
Chapter 5, we saw that the average fragment size generated by EcoRI is about

100

GENOMIC AND cDNA LIBRARIES

4 kb (given certain assumptions about DNA composition), but this is only an
average. Even if restriction sites are randomly distributed we would expect
some fragments to be very much bigger, and some would be very small.
Ligation tends to work best with smaller fragments, so these would be overrepresented in the library, while some of the largest fragments may be too big to
be cloned at all. The problem will be worse if restriction sites are not randomly
distributed. In that case, we can end up with large regions of the genome having
no sites at all for that enzyme.
That is only part of the problem. Identifying a clone carrying a specific DNA
fragment is often not the end of the story. For various reasons, notably for
genome sequencing, we are likely to want to be able to isolate the adjacent
DNA as well. This would enable us to piece together all the small bits of DNA
represented by individual clones so as to build up a bigger picture. If we make a
library of, say, EcoR1 fragments, then we have no way of knowing how they fit
together. There is no information in the library that connects one clone with
another. To provide that information, we need a library of overlapping fragments. Figure 7.1 shows how these overlapping fragments enable the identification of clones on either side of the one that we originally selected. These
clones could then be used to identify further overlapping clones, and so we can
move along the chromosome in either direction. This is the basis of a technique
known as chromosome walking, which we will come back to in Chapter 14.

GENOMIC LIBRARIES

7.1.1 Partial digests
One way to construct a library of overlapping fragments is to use partial
digestion. This means using conditions, such as short digestion times, that
result in only a small proportion of the available sites being cut. A similar
effect can be obtained by using very small amounts of enzyme, or by incubating
the digest at a reduced temperature. The digested material is then fractionated
by electrophoresis to obtain fragments of the required size range before cloning
in an appropriate vector. If there is an equal probability of cutting at any site,
the result will be a series of overlapping fragments (Figure 7.2), which would
overcome the difficulties referred to above. If we do this with an enzyme, such
as EcoRI, that recognizes a six base sequence, the average size of fragments in a
partial digest will be too large for cloning in typical plasmid or lambda vectors,
but vectors that can accommodate large inserts (such as BAC or YAC vectors,
see Chapter 6) can be used for generating a genomic library of such fragments
from a large genome. However, such libraries are not often produced or grown
by individual investigators; they are more likely to be held in centralized
facilities from which individual clones (identified by database searches or
array screening) can be obtained. For smaller genomes, such as those of
bacteria, we would tend to use partial digests with an enzyme that cuts more
frequently, e.g. one such as Sau3A that has a four base recognition site (a `four
base cutter') , and clone the products using a lambda or cosmid vector.
A four base cutter such as Sau3A will produce fragments of 256 bp on
average (assuming an even distribution of sites) and the fragments suitable
for a lambda replacement vector would be 15±20 kb in length, implying that we

are cutting only a few percent of available sites. The reason for requiring such a
low degree of digestion is not only to obtain overlapping fragments, but also
because the distribution of restriction sites is not even. In some places there will
be a number of sites very close together, and if we digest too much we will get
only very small fragments from this region. These will be eliminated by size
fractionation (or will not be suitable for cloning in the chosen vector), resulting
in lack of representation of that region in the library. Thus, in order to
minimize this problem, it is important to ensure that you get your partial
digestion just right. The converse situation ± lack of restriction sites in certain
regions ± is less likely to be an overwhelming problem in this case. There are
unlikely to be any regions where neighbouring Sau3A sites are more than 20 kb
apart, so there should be some Sau3A fragments in the appropriate size range
(although the representation of different parts of the genome may be far from
equal).
There is a further potential problem. We made the assumption that, in a
partial digest, there is an equal probability of the enzyme cutting at any site, but
this is often not true. In a partial digest, some sites may be cut more efficiently
than others. The nature of the adjacent sequences, and the formation of
secondary structures in the DNA, may cause some sites to be cut more rapidly
than others. If this occurs, then our library of partial digest fragments will not
be completely overlapping. When we come to try to fit the clones together we
will find discontinuities in the map so that we will be unable to identify the
adjacent gene (or the clone carrying it). One way of overcoming this is to use
separate partial digests with different enzymes.
Even with a library made in this way, we have not completely guaranteed
that all our problems are solved. There is still the possibility that some regions
of the genome will be over-represented and other regions will occur less
frequently in the library. The only way of avoiding this, and ensuring that all
parts of the chromosome are equally represented, is to abandon the strategy of
using restriction fragments, and instead to use a truly random way of fragmenting the genome. This is most commonly done by mechanical shearing, for
example by passing the solution rapidly and repeatedly through a small syringe
needle. This is an effective way of generating relatively large fragments, and has
the advantage of requiring no special equipment, but the vulnerability of the
DNA to shearing diminishes as the average fragment size decreases. A more
elegant strategy is to use ultrasonication. You can monitor progress by electrophoresis of samples, and recover fragments in the selected size range by
preparative electrophoresis.
Although the complete randomness of mechanical shearing makes it more
attractive in principle than partial digests, most workers continue to use
restriction digests. Not only is it easier to control the extent of degradation,
but also the restriction digests can be directly ligated with the vector. In
contrast, the fragments generated by mechanical shearing have either blunt

7.1

GENOMIC LIBRARIES

103

or `ragged' ends ± that is they may contain variable lengths of single-stranded
regions at the 5H or 3H ends. These are not suitable for ligation, and have to be
converted to blunt ends by filling in or trimming back the ends (see Chapter 5).
Then, since blunt-end ligation is a relatively inefficient process, the addition of
linkers or adaptors (see Chapter 5) might be necessary in order to generate
enough clones to constitute a representative library. However, mechanical
shearing does have a role to play in generating the sets of overlapping fragments that are needed for shotgun sequencing (see Chapter 10).

7.1.2 Choice of vectors
Of the various types of vectors described in Chapter 6, which should we choose
for constructing our genomic library? The principal factor influencing this
choice is the size of the insert that these vectors can accommodate, since this
will affect the size of the library that is necessary to obtain a reasonably
complete representation of the entire genome. Obviously, the required size of
the library will also be affected by the total size of the genome of the target
organism. For any given library, there is a range of options, and the secondary
consideration becomes the ease of making, growing, and screening the library
with the resources available to you.
Superficially, you might think that if we start with a genome of 4 Mb (4 Â 106
bases ± a bacterial genome is of this order of magnitude) and produce a library of
fragments which are 4 kb (4 Â 103 bases) then you should be able to cover the
entire genome with 1000 clones, since (4 Â 106 )=(4 Â 103 )  103 . However, this
would only be possible if (a) all the clones are different, and (b) the clones are
non-overlapping; but we are considering a library of random fragments, so the
first condition is not met, and, as discussed above, we want the library to contain
overlapping fragments, so the second condition does not hold either.
In a random collection of clones, the more clones we look at, the more likely
it is that some of them will be completely or partially identical. In other words,
the larger and more complete the library is, the more redundancy there will be.
As we increase the size of the library it becomes less and less likely that each
additional clone adds any new information; ultimately, it is not possible to
produce a library that is guaranteed to carry all of the genetic information from
the original genome, so we have to use probabilities. We can say there is a 90
per cent probability (P  0:9) of having the gene that we want, or a 99 per cent
probability (P  0:99). The level at which we set this probability will affect the
required size of the library.
More specifically, the number of independent clones needed can be calculated from the formula
N

ln(1 À P)
ln(1 À f )

104

GENOMIC AND cDNA LIBRARIES

where N  required number of clones, P  the probability of the library
containing the desired piece of DNA, and f  the fraction of the genome
represented by an average clone, which is calculated by dividing the average
insert size by the total genome size.
Note that this calculation refers to the number of independent clones, i.e.
the number of bacteria that were transformed originally (or the number of
phage particles arising from a packaging reaction). This is usually determined
from the number of bacterial colonies or phage plaques produced. Once you
have plated out the library, and resuspended the colonies or plaques, you have
amplified the library, and each clone is represented by thousands of individual
bacteria or phage in the tube containing your library. You cannot increase the
size (or complexity) of the library by plating out larger volumes. If your
original library contains 1000 clones, plating it out to produce 10 000 plaques
will simply mean each clone is present (on average) 10 times. You are not
screening 10 000 clones.
Box 7.1 shows that with the example of a bacterial genome of four million
bases and a plasmid vector carrying inserts with an average size of 4 kb we will
need a library of nearly 5000 clones to have a 99 per cent chance of recovering
any specific sequence. (This assumes that all pieces of DNA are equally likely
to turn up in the library, which is not entirely true; some fragments may be
lethal, or may be difficult to clone for other reasons.)
Screening a library of 5000 plasmid clones is possible, but we can shorten the
procedure by using vectors with a greater capacity. We can obtain a representative bacterial genomic library with about a thousand clones, using a lambda
replacement vector. If we use a cosmid vector, the required size of the library
is smaller ± and we can reduce it even more by using vectors with a higher
cloning capacity, but there is a trade-off. One of the main purposes of producing a gene library is to be able to identify clones carrying a specific gene (or
more generally a specific fragment of DNA, which could include regulatory
sequences or other features), so that we can isolate and characterize that
gene. The larger the insert size, the more work we have to do subsequently to
find out which bit of that insert carries the gene we are interested in. (This
can be illustrated by extending the argument to the absurd limit: the smallest
gene library would be represented by a single clone carrying the entire genome,
which would get us no nearer to identifying the gene that we want!) Therefore, for bacterial genomic libraries, lambda replacement vectors are usually
the best compromise (although other vectors such as cosmids are sometimes
used).
Note, however, that genomic libraries can be used for other purposes as well,
especially for mapping and sequencing genomes. For these purposes larger
fragments, which are capable of bridging any gaps that might be present, can

be invaluable. Vectors with a larger cloning capacity, such as cosmids and
BACs, are often used for this purpose (see Chapter 10).
With larger genomes, such as those of mammals, the situation is rather
different. As can be seen from Box 7.1, a library created in a lambda replacement vector would have to consist of nearly a million clones to be reasonably
representative and thus would be more laborious to screen. On the plus side, a
lambda library is reasonably easy to construct in a small laboratory and
without special knowledge or equipment, and a million clones can be screened
on 20 large agar plates. However, wherever feasible, the use of vectors with
larger cloning capacity can reduce the required size of the library to more
manageable proportions.
A further factor that operates in favour of the use of larger inserts with
mammalian (and other eukaryotic) genomes is that genes commonly contain
introns. The overall size of the gene, as present in the genome, may therefore be
too large to be contained within even a lambda replacement vector. (Although
some bacterial genes do carry introns, they are relatively uncommon.) Therefore, if we need to obtain a clone carrying the entire gene, we will have to use a
vector which can accommodate a large enough DNA fragment.

106

GENOMIC AND cDNA LIBRARIES

In the discussion so far, we have implicitly assumed that the library will be
screened by replicating the clones to a filter, followed by hybridization with a
labelled nucleic acid probe (see Chapter 8). Lambda vectors have a technical
advantage over the other vectors in this process in that it is easier to screen
phage plaques at high density than bacterial colonies. Not only do bacterial
colonies tend to grow into one another if plated at high density, but also they
tend to smudge when blotted, which can make it difficult to identify the
required colony.

7.1.3 Construction and evaluation of a genomic library
The basis of the construction of a genomic library has been covered partly in
earlier chapters and partly by this chapter so far. By way of a recap, the
genomic DNA is fragmented, as randomly as possible, into suitable-sized
pieces for insertion into your chosen vector. The vector is prepared by digestion
with the appropriate enzyme and (for a lambda replacement vector) removing
the stuffer fragment. It is often more convenient to buy a ready-prepared
vector. The vector is then ligated with the complete mixture of genomic
fragments. If you have chosen a lambda vector, or a cosmid, you will need to
mix your ligation products with packaging extracts for the assembly of infectious phage particles (see Chapter 6). If you are using a plasmid vector, you will
introduce the mixture of ligated DNA into a bacterial cell by transformation or
electroporation. The library will then be obtained as bacterial colonies (if using
plasmid or cosmid vectors, or BACs) or phage plaques on a bacterial lawn
(with lambda vectors). A library in a yeast artificial chromosome vector (YAC)
can be similarly electroporated into yeast cells.
For storage of the library, you would make a pooled suspension of the
bacterial colonies, or of the phage harvested from the plate(s). Note that this
library has already undergone an amplification. The original unamplified
library is represented by the initial transformants, when each bacterial cell or
phage particle is a unique product from a single molecular ligation event. Once
you have plated them out to obtain colonies or plaques, each clone is represented many thousands of times in the library.
You then want to know how good your library is. First, you count the
number of colonies or plaques (at an appropriate dilution so that you get
countable colonies/plaques); if you do this using the original plates, it tells
you the size (or complexity) of your library. If you determine the titre (the
number of colonies or phage plaques) of the resuspended mixture, you will get
a falsely elevated estimate of the size of the library. The amplification of gene
libraries (Figure 7.3) is illustrated with a plasmid vector. The concept with a
phage vector is the same, except that plaques are produced and the amplified

library will consist of phage particles. The library would consist of thousands
or millions of clones, rather than the few shown.
Second, you will want to determine the quality of the library, i.e. what
proportion of the clones actually contain an insert, and how large are those
inserts? Both of these questions can be answered by picking a number of clones,
growing them up individually, extracting the plasmid or phage DNA and
subjecting it to restriction digestion followed by agarose gel electrophoresis.
The details will vary according to the vector and cloning strategy, but at the
simplest level (insertion of restriction fragments into a plasmid) you will see
that each clone has one band of constant size corresponding to the vector,
and bands of various sizes which are your insert fragments (Figure 7.4). By
determining the size of these fragments, you can estimate the average insert
size in your library (assuming you have picked a representative sample). Those
without an insert band (see track 5) are probably religated vector, so you
can estimate what proportion of clones do not have an insert at all. Clearly

you do not want too many of these, as it will reduce the efficiency of your
screening.
In Chapter 6, we described how some vectors, such as lambda gt11 or plasmid
vectors of the pUC family (such as pUC18), provide you with a more direct
estimate of the proportion of clones lacking an insert. With these examples, the
non-recombinant vectors (without an insert) will produce blue plaques/colonies
on an X-gal/IPTG containing plate (due to the b-galactosidase gene in the
vector). If you have successfully introduced an insert fragment into the vector,
the insert will (usually) disrupt the b-galactosidase gene, giving `white' clones.
Any religated or intact vector will give blue plaques or colonies. Lambda
replacement vectors should not produce any clones simply lacking an insert
(as they would be too small to be packaged) but intact vector may persist, or the
stuffer fragment may not have been completely removed. Many replacement
vectors contain additional markers to enable further differentiation or selection
of recombinant clones. Cosmids also provide positive selection for the presence

7.2 GROWING AND STORING LIBRARIES

109

of inserts, again because the religated empty vector is too small for the packaging reaction.
Ideally, each clone should contain a single insert fragment. Multiple inserts
can cause problems later on, as they will provide misleading information
about the relationship between different parts of the genome. With those
vectors that provide positive selection for inserts (lambda replacement
vectors and cosmids) it is possible to dephosphorylate the insert (using alkaline
phosphatase) ± rather than the vector ± thus virtually eliminating the possibility of multiple inserts. If you do this with other vectors, you run the risk of
obtaining an unacceptably high frequency of vector religation. It may be
worth running this risk, especially if you are using a vector such as pUC18 or
lambda gt11 when you can tell straight away what your insertion frequency is.
If you get too many blue colonies/plaques, then you throw the library away and
try again.

7.2 Growing and Storing Libraries
Once a library has been made, it represents a potentially useful resource for
subsequent experiments, as well as for the initial purpose for which it was
produced. You will therefore want to store it safely for future use. A random
library will consist of a tube containing a suspension of pooled colonies from a
plate (if you used a plasmid or cosmid vector), or pooled bacteriophage
particles (for a phage vector). This would normally be kept at À808C; bacterial
cells in a plasmid library are protected from the adverse effects of freezing by
glycerol. Phage libraries, by contrast, are kept as cell-free virus particles,
cryoprotected by dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO). When the library is to be
screened, a small lump of the frozen stock is removed and thawed, leaving
the rest of the aliquot frozen. Plasmid libraries in cells are simply spread out on
agar plates containing the appropriate antibiotic, which ensures that the cells
do not shed their plasmids. Phage libraries, on the other hand, first need to be
mixed with prepared bacterial cells before being plated out.
If your library is a valuable one, or if you are likely to be using it repeatedly,
it is preferable to divide it into aliquots before freezing it, so that each aliquot is
only thawed once. This avoids the loss of clones that will accompany repeated
freezing and thawing. The same principle applies to gridded and ordered
libraries (see below), but even more strongly. The ideal arrangement is to
have one master copy of the library which is kept for emergencies, and several
sub-master copies, also stored at À808C, which will each be used only a limited
number of times to produce a working copy as and when required.
The first task is to determine the titre of the library, which almost inevitably
will have dropped since the original stock was frozen. A dilution series is
produced and each dilution is spread out on an agar plate and grown at 378C

110

GENOMIC AND cDNA LIBRARIES

overnight. This allows the investigator to calculate the titre of the library, and
to determine how much is to be used for each plate in the actual screening. The
number of clones required for the screen can be calculated using the formula
described above. In a genomic library every gene is (ideally) represented
equally often. Thus, the number of clones that need to be screened is dependent
on (a) the size of the fragments in the library, and (b) the size of the genome.
In the next section, we describe the construction of a different sort of library,
using cDNA produced by reverse transcription of mRNA. To determine the
number of clones in a cDNA library that you need to screen, you have to take
account of the abundance of the relevant mRNA. If you are searching for a
cDNA clone for a reasonably abundant mRNA, you might have to screen
20 000 clones (10 plates), while for a very rare transcript, you might need
200 000 clones (100 plates).

7.3 cDNA Libraries
A genomic library represents all the DNA in the genome, whether it is
expressed or not. However, very often it is really the genes that are being
expressed that are our main target. This is likely to be quite a small proportion
of the total DNA especially in; for example, mammalian cells. So if we base our
library on the mRNA extracted from the target cells, rather than on their
DNA, we will be able to focus our library more closely on the real target,
and make the identification of the required clones much more efficient.
The advantages of cDNA libraries, and the contrast with genomic libraries,
extend further than that. First of all, since the introns are removed by processing the mRNA, the cDNA clones will reflect only the coding regions of the gene
(exons) rather than the much longer sequence contained in the genome. This is
especially relevant if we want to try to express the gene in a bacterial host,
which will be unable to splice the mRNA.
Secondly, in any organism, some or most of the DNA does not appear to
code for anything, or to have any other identifiable purpose. This is often
referred to as junk DNA ± but we need to be careful in this interpretation, as
some of these sequences may have a function that we have not yet ascertained.
Some of this apparent junk represents integrated viral DNA (including bacteriophages in bacterial genomes), or the remains of integrated viruses that
have lost the ability to produce functional viral particles. Genomes also commonly contain sequences which are in effect DNA parasites (such as insertion
sequences and transposons), as well as other repetitive elements, which do not
necessarily contribute anything to the overall properties of the cell. There are
also pseudogenes, which appear to be non-functional copies of real genes, as
they contain a number of changes in the sequence, such as stop codons, which
preclude their expression. Although pseudogenes are (presumably) redundant

7.3

cDNA LIBRARIES

111

gene copies so that loss of function can be tolerated, and might therefore be
labelled as `junk DNA', they nevertheless represent an evolutionary resource
and may evolve later on into new genes with novel functions.
The amount of apparent junk in the genome is to some extent related to
genome size. Bacterial genomes carry mobile elements and phages, and some
other repetitive elements, but in most cases relatively few obvious pseudogenes
(although there are many potential coding sequences to which we cannot
ascribe any function). With larger genomes, such as those of mammals, the
proportion of junk DNA is much higher.
A library based on mRNA, rather than a genomic library, will reflect only
those genes that are actually expressed in a particular cell or tissue sample at a
particular time. Hence we will eliminate all the real junk. However, it goes
further than that. A cell will use only a part of its genetic capability at any one
time. A bacterial cell will switch genes on or off, depending on its environment
and its stage of growth; and in a multicellular organism, differentiation of cells
into tissues and organs will be reflected in more or less permanent changes in
the nature of the genes that are expressed. Some genes will be active only during
specific developmental stages; others will be active during specific times of the
day. You may also choose to make a library from a cancerous sample, or from
an individual who suffers from a genetic disease. A library of this sort will
reflect the nature of the cells from which the mRNA was obtained. As we will
see later on, this not only reduces very substantially the number of clones
needed for a representative library, but it also provides us with a variety of
ways in which we can focus attention on the differences between various cells or
tissues, and thus identify genes that are selectively expressed in different environments or in different tissues.
However, we cannot directly clone the mRNA. We have to produce a
complementary DNA (cDNA) copy; hence the designation of such a library
as a cDNA library. The synthesis of the cDNA is carried out using an enzyme
known as reverse transcriptase. (Since transcription refers to the production of
RNA from a DNA template, the opposite process ± RNA-directed DNA
synthesis ± is known as reverse transcription.) Although this is not a normal
process in most cells, some types of viruses, such as leukaemia viruses and HIV,
replicate in this fashion; the viral particle contains RNA which is copied into
DNA after infection, using a virus-encoded enzyme. Some cellular DNA
polymerases also have reverse transcription capability.

7.3.1 Isolation of mRNA
Most of the RNA in a cell is not messenger RNA. The initial RNA preparation
will contain substantial amounts of ribosomal RNA and transfer RNA. For
effective production of cDNA for construction of a library it is highly desirable

to purify the mRNA. This can be done with eukaryotic cells, where we can take
advantage of the fact that mRNA carries a tail at the 3H end ± a string of A
residues that is added post-transcriptionally. The polyadenylated mRNA will
anneal to synthetic oligo(dT) sequences (i.e. short polymers of deoxythymidine,
or in other words short stretches of synthetic DNA containing just T residues).
Other RNA species, and non-RNA components will not anneal and can be
washed off (Figure 7.5). Although some mRNA in bacteria does have polyA
tails, these are much shorter and only a small proportion of mRNA is polyadenylated. Therefore, this does not provide a reliable way of isolating bacterial
mRNA. The question of the production of bacterial cDNA is discussed below.
When the RNA preparation is passed through a column of a polymer coated
with synthetic oligo(dT) fragments, the polyA tail will anneal to the oligo(dT)
residues and will be retained on the column while other RNA species will pass
through. This is in effect a hybridization process, and as such the hybrids can
be made unstable by lowering the salt concentration and raising the temperature, enabling the elution of purified mRNA from the column (Figure 7.6).
This will consist of a complex mixture of all the mRNA species present in the
cell at the time of extraction. The relative amounts of the different transcripts
will vary substantially, which has major implications for the ease of obtaining
certain cDNA clones. This is a further clear distinction from a genomic library.
Although the following description is presented in terms of a single mRNA,
bear in mind that we would in reality be dealing with a complex mixture.

7.3.2 cDNA synthesis
The presence of the polyA tail is also used to advantage in the reverse transcription step (Figure 7.7). Reverse transcriptase, like DNA-directed DNA
polymerase, requires a primer for initiation. An oligo(dT) primer will anneal to

the polyA tail; reverse transcriptase will then extend this primer, using the
mRNA as the template, and will produce a single-stranded cDNA copy.
We now have a double-stranded molecule that is a hybrid between DNA and
RNA. In order to obtain a molecule that is stable and can be cloned into a
vector, we need to replace the RNA with a DNA strand of the same sequence.
First, the RNA is partially degraded by a specific RNAse called RNAse A,
which is able to attack double-stranded molecules. This leaves the cDNA
strand largely in single-stranded form. Single-stranded nucleic acid molecules
tend to form secondary structures, looping back on themselves, because of the
hydrophobicity of the bases. The single-stranded cDNA will therefore tend to
form a hairpin loop at the 3H end. This hairpin loop, and the partial remains of
the RNA strand, are used by DNA polymerase I as primers for second strand
synthesis. The product is a double-stranded DNA molecule, with a hairpin loop
at one end. That loop is then removed by treatment with S1 nuclease (which
will cut single-stranded DNA, including exposed loops). Further treatment
with DNA polymerase will ensure that the molecule is fully blunt-ended.
For cloning the cDNA, adapters (see Chapter 5) are added, by blunt-end
ligation, to make the cDNA molecules compatible with the chosen vector
(Figure 7.8). After size-fractionation, eliminating excess adapters and small,
abortive cDNA fragments, the library is inserted into the vector in a second

ligation. Because transcripts are not usually longer than a few kb, larger vectors
are not considered for cDNA libraries ± the choice is essentially between a
plasmid vector, or a phage lambda insertion vector such as gt10 or gt11.
(The relative advantages and disadvantages of these vectors were discussed in
Chapter 6.)
One limitation of the basic procedure described above is that you may not
get full-length cDNA. Constraints such as elements of secondary structure in
the mRNA may interfere with reverse transcription, so that the enzyme rarely,
if ever, reaches the end of the mRNA. As a result, the regions at the 5H end of
the mRNA may be under-represented in the cDNA library. This can be
partially addressed by using random primers rather than oligo-dT primers.
These random primers will initiate first strand cDNA synthesis at intermediate
points, and hence the enzyme will be more likely to reach the 5H end of the
mRNA (see Figure 7.9). Obviously, you will not then get any clones containing

full-length cDNA, but these clones containing the 5H end can be compared to
other clones carrying the 3H portion, making it possible to devise strategies for
obtaining full-length molecules. The use of random primers rather than oligodT primers also overcomes the problem that some RNA molecules (e.g. bacterial mRNA and genomic RNA from viruses) are not polyadenylated.
The requirement for hairpin formation to prime second strand synthesis can
also reduce the representation of the 5H ends. One strategy to counter this is to
use terminal transferase to add a tail to the 3H end of the first cDNA strand (see
Figure 7.9). As described in Chapter 5, terminal transferase, if provided with,
say, dCTP, will add a string of C residues to the 3H ends of DNA molecules.
This enables the use of an oligo-dG primer to initiate second strand synthesis,
without requiring hairpin formation.
Many variations of these strategies have been devised to obtain full-length
cDNA. The most powerful strategy, known as rapid amplification of cDNA
ends (RACE), exploits the amplification power of the polymerase chain reaction; this is discussed in Chapter 9.

7.3.3 Bacterial cDNA
The arguments in favour of cDNA, rather than genomic, libraries carry much
less force with bacterial targets. The smaller size of bacterial genomes, and the
(virtual) absence of introns, means that a genomic library is usually quite
adequate ± and a lot easier to construct. There are additional technical difficulties in producing cDNA with bacteria. Not only is the mRNA not consistently
polyadenylated, but it is also remarkably unstable ± many bacterial mRNA
species have a half-life (in vivo) of only a minute or two. Furthermore, the
organization of bacterial genes into polycistronic operons (groups of genes that
are transcribed into a single long mRNA) means that a bacterial mRNA can be
as much as 10±20 kb in length. Not only is it difficult to isolate this mRNA
intact, but it would be very difficult to produce a full-length cDNA copy
from it.
As a consequence, bacterial cDNA libraries are rarely produced. However,
for some purposes, such as the analysis of gene expression (see Chapter 13),
cloning of bacterial cDNA can play an important role, for example in identifying those transcripts that are relatively abundant in the bacterial cells under
selected conditions.

7.4 Random, Arrayed and Ordered Libraries
So far we have envisaged a gene library as a single tube containing a mixture of
a large number of clones. When you want to screen the library, you plate it out

7.4

RANDOM, ARRAYED AND ORDERED LIBRARIES

117

to give plates with a large number of bacterial colonies or phage plaques. For
many purposes, this is perfectly adequate. However, there are circumstances
when you do not want to treat the library as a random collection of a large
number of clones. For example, if you have a very complex screening procedure, you may be able to test only a portion of the library at a time. This might
mean taking a small aliquot of the library and testing say 100 clones. If you
then take another aliquot, and again test 100 clones, then some of those clones
may be the same ones that you have already tested. (Remember that your
library has been amplified. so each independent clone is present in many
copies.)
One way around this is to produce an arrayed or gridded library. If we go
back to the original transformation step (or infection with the packaged phage
particles), then instead of simply pooling all the clones and storing them in one
tube, we can pick them individually and store them separately (Figure 7.10).
This can be done using individual wells in microtitre trays, or sometimes on
filters. If you are doing this manually, then you are limited in the size of library
that you can handle (depending on how patient you are). For a bacterial library
with, say, a few thousand clones, this is possible. However, there are now
machines available that will identify colonies on a plate, pick them individually
and transfer them to individual wells in a microtitre tray. Once you have an
arrayed library in a microtitre tray, it is then relatively easy to subculture the
clones to trays with fresh culture medium, creating multiple and identical
copies of your library. You can then work your way through the library, testing
each clone individually, knowing that every well contains a different clone.
Alternatively, the library can be replicated to agar plates, or directly to membranes, which can then be screened to identify specific clones, as described in
Chapter 8.
Replicating such a library onto a membrane is one way of producing another
form of array, consisting of spots of DNA rather than viable clones. For a

larger library, for example a human gene library, you would want to screen the
library at a much higher density. That is, you would want to put the spots on
the filter much closer together than would be obtained by merely replicating
from the microtitre tray. This requires very precise positioning of the spots on
the filter, which is achieved by using another robot.
The availability of genome sequence data makes it possible to produce DNA
arrays without constructing a gene library, using PCR products or synthetic
oligonucleotides. These either use nylon membranes (macroarrays) or glass
slides (microarrays), and are especially useful for analysing variations in
genome content and genome-wide analyses of transcription. The use of such
arrays is considered in Chapters 12 and 13.
It is not necessary to be able to produce your own arrays, or to own your
own robots. Arrays representing genomic and cDNA libraries from a considerable range of organisms are readily available from public and commercial
resource centres, as well as facilities for producing such arrays from your
own libraries. The most comprehensive collection is housed by the German
Human Genome Project (http://www.rzpd.de). After obtaining the array and
screening it, the investigator can order the positive clones from the resource
centre.
An arrayed library still consists of a random set of clones. Without screening
it, we have no information as to the nature of the insert in each clone, or the
Clones in a random genomic library

relationship between clones. A further development of the concept is to establish which clones overlap so that we can produce a set of clones that can be
arranged in order, so as to cover the whole genome. This can be done by
hybridization between sets of clones, so that if the insert in clone 1 overlaps
with that in clone 2 then we know that they are adjacent and overlapping in the
genome (Figure 7.11). Because of the inherent redundancy in a random library,
the number of clones required in an ordered library is much less; some of the
clones in the random library will not be needed. The actual number of clones
needed will depend on the degree of overlap between the chosen clones, as well
as the insert size.
An ordered library can be a valuable resource. Ordered libraries have
contributed substantially to some of the genome sequencing projects ± notably
the public human genome sequencing consortium used an ordered library of
BAC clones. However, the work required to establish an ordered library is
substantial, even for a relatively small genome such as that of a bacterium, and
even using relatively large inserts such as those in a cosmid library. More recent
developments in sequencing technology, and in the computer techniques for
assembling sequence data from large numbers of small fragments (see Chapter
10), provide alternatives to the production of ordered libraries as strategies for
genome sequencing.

8 Finding the Right Clone
8.1 Screening Libraries with Gene Probes
In the previous chapter, we described how to create a gene library. Whether it is
a genomic library or a cDNA library, it is a large collection of random clones,
and we still have to find a way of identifying which clone(s) carry the gene that
we are interested in. (We can ignore the more specialized topic of ordered
libraries.) This means that we need ways of rapidly screening very large numbers
of clones. This is most commonly done using a nucleic acid probe (DNA or
RNA), which will hybridize to the DNA sequence you are looking for in a
specific clone. The principle involved is that the library (in the form of bacterial
colonies or phage plaques) is replicated onto a filter, which is then treated to
release the DNA and bind it to the filter, which then carries a pattern of DNA
spots that replicates the position of the colonies or plaques on the original plate.
The filter is then hybridized with the probe, which has first been labelled so that
it can be easily detected. This allows you to detect which DNA spots hybridize
to the probe, and recover the corresponding clones from the original plate.
In order to appreciate the power of this technique it is necessary to consider
more closely the question of hybridization. Later in this chapter we will
consider an alternative strategy, which involves using antibodies to screen an
expression library.

8.1.1 Hybridization
Hybridization is based on the difference in stability between the covalent bonds
in the nucleic acid backbone of each strand, and the much weaker hydrogen
bonds that bind the two strands in the double helix together by base pairing.
Thanks to this arrangement, the two strands can be safely separated ± both in
the cell and in the test tube ± under conditions that are much too mild to pose
any threat to the covalent bonds in the backbone. This is referred to as
denaturation of DNA, and unlike the denaturation of most proteins it is reversible. Because of the complementarity of the base pairs, the strands will easily
join together again and renature. In the test tube, DNA is readily denatured by

122

FINDING THE RIGHT CLONE

heating, and the denaturation process is therefore often referred to as melting
even when it is accomplished enzymatically (e.g. by DNA polymerase) or
chemically (e.g. by NaOH). The separation of the strands during renaturation
causes a radical change in the physical properties of DNA, such as optical
density (Figure 8.1). During melting of DNA, the optical density changes
dramatically during a short temperature interval, and then stabilizes after the
strands have separated entirely. The midpoint of this temperature interval is
denoted the melting temperature (Tm ). Under physiological conditions, the Tm
is usually 85±958C (depending on the base composition of the DNA). In the
laboratory, we can adjust other factors, such as the salt concentration (see
below) to bring the melting temperature down to a more convenient range.
The reason that the Tm varies according to the base composition of the DNA
is that guanine±cytosine base pairs are joined together by three hydrogen
bonds, whereas adenosine±thymidine base pairs have only two. If we take
reasonably large DNA molecules, such as might be obtained by isolating
total DNA from an organism, we can make an estimate of its base composition
by measuring the Tm . Alternatively, if we know the base composition, we can
calculate the Tm . For shorter sequences, such as the 20±30 base synthetic
oligonucleotides that are commonly used as primers, other factors have to be
taken into account. The strength of the association between two bases (expressed as DG, the energy released on formation of a base pair) depends also on
the adjacent bases, because hydrophobic interactions between adjacent bases
(stacking) also affects the stability of the pairing. Some examples are shown in
Figure 8.2, where it can be seen that the free energy of base pairing (kcal/mol)
for the CG/GC doublet is not the same as for the GC/CG doublet. The negative
values indicate that energy is released on formation of a base-paired structure.
More energy released means greater stability. For short oligonucleotides,
calculation of the Tm therefore has to take account of the context of each
base in the sequence. (Computer programs are readily available to do this for

you.) This is not likely to be such an important factor in determining the Tm of
a longer stretch of DNA because there will be a tendency for these differences
to average out.
Although the normal base pairs (A±T and G±C) are the only forms that are
fully compatible with the canonical Watson±Crick double helix, pairing of
other bases can occur, especially in situations where a regular double helix is
less important (such as the folding of single-stranded nucleic acids into secondary structures ± see below).
In addition to the hydrogen bonds, the double-stranded DNA structure is
maintained by hydrophobic interactions between the bases on opposite
strands. (This is in addition to the hydrophobic stacking of adjacent bases on
the same strand, as referred to above.) The hydrophobic nature of the bases
means that a single-stranded structure, in which the bases are exposed to the
aqueous environment, is unstable; pairing of the bases enables them to be
removed from interaction with the surrounding water. In contrast to the
hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions are relatively non-specific, i.e.
nucleic acid strands will tend to stick together even in the absence of specific
base-pairing, although the specific interactions enables a stronger association.
The specificity of the interaction can therefore be increased by the use of
chemicals (such as formamide) that reduce the hydrophobic interactions.
What happens if there is only a single strand, as is the case normally with
RNA, and sometimes with DNA? In that case, removal of bases from the
surrounding water is accomplished by the formation of secondary structures in
which the nucleic acid folds up on itself to form localized double-stranded
regions, including structures referred to as hairpins or stem-loop structures. At
room temperature, in the absence of denaturing agents, a single-stranded
nucleic acid will normally consist of a complex set of such localized secondary
structure elements.

124

FINDING THE RIGHT CLONE

A further factor to be taken into account is the negative charge on the
phosphate groups in the nucleic acid backbone. This works in the opposite
direction to the hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions; the strong
negative charge on the DNA strands causes electrostatic repulsion that tends
to repel the two strands. In the presence of salt, this effect is counteracted by
the presence of a cloud of counterions surrounding the molecule, neutralising
the negative charge on the phosphate groups. However, if you reduce the salt
concentration, any weak interactions between the strands will be disrupted by
electrostatic repulsion ± hence the use of low salt conditions to increase the
specificity of hybridization (see below).
If two similar, but different, double-stranded DNA fragments are mixed,
melted, and then left to renature, some of them will reform hybrids with their
perfectly complementary halves, but others will have formed hybrids (Figure
8.3). This would happen, for example, if you were to mix the cDNA molecules
encoding the human red- and green-sensitive photopigments, or the actin genes
from mouse and rat. Any base pairs that do not match will cause imperfections
in the resulting hybrid double helix. A higher number of mismatches will lead
to a less stable hybrid ± in other words one that would have a lower melting
temperature.
This is very important when single strands of nucleic acids are hybridized in
the laboratory. The investigator can choose conditions that would be more or
less forgiving of partial mismatches, depending on if they are wanted or not.
This is referred to as varying the stringency of the hybridization. The most
important and obvious way to do this is by altering the temperature. Secondly,
hybrids are more stable at higher salt concentrations. At low salt concentrations, the negative charges of the phosphate groups in the backbones cause

an electrostatic repulsion between the two strands. At higher salt concentrations, the presence of positive counterions will relieve this repulsion. In the
laboratory, salt concentration is usually regulated as multiples of SSC (Standard Saline Citrate; 1 Â SSC is defined as 0.15 M sodium chloride and 0.015 M
sodium citrate). Sometimes, formamide is added to the hybridization solution.
Formamide lowers the melting temperature and is therefore used in situations
where hybridization temperatures need to be kept low, such as when carrying
out in situ hybridization (see Chapter 13).
The basic types of hybridization that are used in the laboratory are filter
hybridization, solution hybridization, and in situ hybridization. In all three of
them, one nucleic acid fragment, the probe, is labelled in order to detect and
locate a complementary DNA strand ± the target.

8.1.2 Labelling probes
A fundamental feature of nucleic acid hybridization is that the probe is labelled
in a way which will make it possible to detect it ± and thereby (indirectly) the
target it has bound to ± after the hybridization. The classic labelling method is
to incorporate a radioactive isotope into the probe molecule. Isotopes that are
used for this include 32 P, 33 P, 35 S, and 3 H. A more energetic isotope, such as
32
P, gives a stronger signal, but less good resolution. This makes it useful for
experiments where sub-millimetre resolution is irrelevant, such as Southern
blot hybridization (see below). At the other extreme, 3 H gives a weaker signal
and thus requires a much longer exposure time to be detectable. On the other
hand, it provides excellent resolution, and can be used in experiments such as in
situ hybridization (Chapter 13), where it is important to be able to assign the
probe labelling not only to specific cells, but even to specific regions of
chromosomes.
The classical way to detect radiolabelled probes is to place the probe-target
hybrid on an X-ray film. Radioactive particles will expose the region of the film
with which they are in contact just like X-rays or visible light would. A more
modern method for detecting binding of radioisotopes is phosphoimaging.
This method requires specialized and expensive apparatus but is, on the other
hand, faster and the phosphoimaging plates can be reused, in contrast to X-ray
films.
Many investigators have abandoned radioactive labelling methods in favour
of non-radioactive ones. These have advantages over radioactive ones in terms
of worker safety, detection speed, and cost. They are also unaffected by
the continuous decay of radioisotopes, and are therefore more stable. There
are a variety of non-radioactive labels that can be used. Nucleotides substituted
with biotin or digoxigenin can be incorporated into the probe, and then
detected with specific antibodies (or, in the case of biotin, using avidin,

126

FINDING THE RIGHT CLONE

which bind very strongly and specifically to biotin). The antibody (or
avidin) that is used is itself labelled with an enzyme, such as horseradish
peroxidase (HRP) or alkaline phosphatase, so it can be detected using a
chromogenic substrate (i.e. a substrate that yields a coloured product when
reacted with the enzyme) or a chemiluminescent substrate (where the initial
reaction product is unstable and light is emitted as it breaks down). In the latter
case, the emitted light will darken X-ray film just like a radioisotope would. As
with radioactive methods, specialized equipment can be used instead of X-ray
film.
Alternatively, the probe can be labelled directly with HRP, or a fluorescent
label can be incorporated, which allows direct detection of the labelled probe.
Such probes are especially useful in the technique known as fluorescent in situ
hybridization or FISH (Chapter 16).

8.1.3 Steps in a hybridization experiment
Nucleic acid probes have a tendency to bind non-specifically to other materials
on the filter, or even to the filter itself. To minimize this non-specific probe
binding, the hybridization solution contains various blocking agents, which
may include detergents, bovine serum albumin, and non-homologous DNA. It
is often advantageous to pretreat the filter with the hybridization solution
without added probe (prehybridization).
If the probe is double-stranded DNA, it will need to be heat-denatured by
boiling prior to hybridization in order to make it accessible to the target. It is
then added to the target in the hybridization solution.
After hybridization, which typically takes place in a controlled-temperature
chamber overnight, non-specifically bound probe is removed by washing. This
is the step where the investigator can most conveniently decide how tolerant
the experiment should be of partially mismatched probe-target hybrids, by
choosing an appropriate combination of temperature and salt concentration.
If, for example, the intention is to hybridize a cDNA probe with genomic
DNA from the same species, then high stringency conditions (i.e. high temperature and low salt concentration) should be chosen (Figure 8.4). This will
ensure that the probe will remain bound to the membrane only where it
has annealed to the correct complementary sequences. Where the probe has
annealed to DNA that is partially similar (for example members of the same
gene family), the annealing will be disrupted by these conditions, and the probe
will be washed off the filter. If, on the other hand, the investigator wishes to
detect, say, a fish gene with a probe made from human DNA (a heterologous
probe), then low stringency (i.e. low temperature and high salt concentration)
should be chosen in order to protect the expected partially mismatched
hybrids.

The hybridization of the filter with an appropriate probe is the first example
of filter hybridization that we will come across in this book. In filter hybridization, as the name implies, the target is immobilized in a filter and the probe is
free in the hybridization solution until it binds to the target. Other important
application of filter hybridization include Southern blots (see later in this
chapter) and Northern blots (Chapter 13). In both cases, the target nucleic
acids are first size-separated in an electrophoresis gel before being transferred
onto the membrane. The difference between them is that in Southern blots the
target nucleic acids are fragments of DNA while Northern blots are used for
the identification of RNA. The subsequent hybridization of these filters follows
the same principles as outlined above.

8.1.4 Screening procedure
We can now return to the question of screening a gene library, and how you use
hybridization with a gene probe to identify a specific clone. Remember that at
this stage your gene library is in the form of a number of colonies (or phage
plaques) on an agar plate (or a number of such plates). The first step is to
produce a replica filter of each plate, using a procedure known as a colony lift
(or a plaque lift). A nitrocellulose or nylon membrane is placed on top of the
plate, and the orientation is marked by piercing the membrane and the plate

128

FINDING THE RIGHT CLONE

with a needle dipped in ink. During the minute or so that the membrane is left
on the plate, part of each bacterial colony, or some of the phages from each
plaque, will bind to the membrane. The membrane is then soaked in a sodium
hydroxide solution, which releases the DNA from the cells or phage, and
denatures it. After neutralization with a buffer solution, the single-stranded
DNA molecules are fixed to the membrane by heat or UV irradiation. The
membrane filter is then hybridized with the appropriate probe. Following
hybridization, the filter is washed, under the chosen stringency conditions,
before detection of the probe, using procedures appropriate for the nature of
the label.
If you are successful, you will now have an X-ray film with one or more black
spots on it that marks the position of the clones that you want on the original
plate. You then return to that plate, align it with the X-ray film image, pick that
colony and subculture it. This is the clone that you want. This procedure is
summarized in Figure 8.5.
In practice, especially if you are screening a library at high density, you
are unlikely to be able to pick an individual clone without also collecting some
of the neighbouring ones. You will then have to use this mixture of clones
for rescreening at a lower density. Furthermore, some of the clones will be false
positives (for various reasons), and so it will be necessary to submit them
to further testing to verify their identity. We will come back to these concepts
later on.

8.1.5 Probe selection and generation
Screening a gene library with a nucleic acid probe implies that you have access
to a suitable DNA (or RNA) fragment. Yet the whole purpose of screening a
gene library is to isolate a clone carrying a novel piece of DNA. There are a
variety of ways around this circular argument. First, there are cases where you
actually are screening with a probe emanating from the same gene and the same
species; this is called homologous probing. In this chapter we will describe this,
the use of heterologous probes and probes generated by back translation (as well
as the use of antibodies to screen expression libraries). Chapter 9 will describe
another approach, which is the use of PCR-based techniques for generating
suitable probes, and differential and subtractive hybridization methods are
described in Chapter 13.

Homologous probes
Why would you use a probe coming from the same gene in the same species?
This is not as strange an idea as it may seem. First, you may already have a
clone, but an incomplete one. You may not have the complete cDNA sequence,
or you may want to walk further down a chromosome, for example in the
search for further promoter elements. You may also have access to a cDNA
clone, but desire to know the genomic sequence that encodes it. Finally, your
business may be to study genetic variation between individuals or strains,
whether polymorphisms or mutations causing disease. However, for at least
some of these purposes it would be much easier to use PCR (see Chapter 9) to
amplify that bit of DNA from the genome of other individuals than to screen a
gene library with the homologous probe.

Heterologous probes
If the gene we are trying to clone is not completely unknown, but a corresponding one has already been cloned and characterized from another source,
then we can use that characterized clone as a probe. So in isolating the human
insulin gene, for example, it was possible to use the previously characterized
rat insulin gene to probe a human gene library.
This takes advantage of the fact that genes with the same function are often
very similar in different organisms (we will see examples of this in Chapter 11.)
As we would expect, the similarity tends to be greatest for the most closely
related species (you might not like to think it but we are closely related to rats in
this sense!). The extent of the relationship varies from one gene to another;

130

FINDING THE RIGHT CLONE

some genes are very highly conserved while others are more variable. Generally, the closer the relationship between the two species, the more reliable the
screening is likely to be.
If we move in the other direction, towards less closely related species, then the
similarity is likely to decline to a level at which we can no longer detect
hybridization using high stringency conditions. This does not mean that the
probe is useless. It is quite common to screen gene libraries with heterologous
probes that require lower stringency (e.g. lower temperature or higher ionic
strength) in order to hybridize to the target clone. However, there is a price to be
paid. As you lower the stringency in order to allow your heterologous probe to
hybridize, so you also allow the probe to hybridize to other genes which are
similar to the gene you are trying to clone. In other words, you are more likely to
get false positive signals. A certain proportion of false positives can be tolerated
(indeed you are likely to encounter some false positives, however good your
probe is); these have to be eliminated by further screening and checking (see
below). However, if the ratio of false to genuine positives becomes too high,
then the re-screening becomes prohibitively time-consuming. (The precise point
at which this ratio becomes unacceptable will depend on how badly you want
the clone and whether you can think of any other way of getting it.)

Back translation
An alternative strategy becomes possible if you are able to obtain in pure form
the protein that is encoded by the gene of interest. It is then possible to
determine part of the amino acid sequence of the protein (usually starting
from the N-terminal region), and to use that information to infer the likely
sequence of the gene itself. Since this process (which does not occur in nature,
only in your mind ± or your computer) is the reverse of normal translation it is
referred to as back translation or reverse translation. Once you have done that,
you can then synthesize an appropriate nucleic acid probe.
In addition, this approach can be used even when no protein has been
purified or sequenced. A back translation can be made from a predicted region
of a protein you believe to exist, either by analogy with a different species or
using a specific known domain.
However, you have to remember the redundancy of the genetic code. If you
know the DNA or RNA sequence you can predict accurately the amino acid
sequence of the protein (subject to a few peripheral assumptions). The fact that
several different codons end up coding for the same amino acid does not affect
the inference in the real translation direction. However, in the reverse direction
it is a different matter. If you know there is, say, a leucine residue in the protein
at a specific position, then you have considerable uncertainty over what the
DNA sequence actually is. It could be any one of six codons (see Box 8.1).

You can easily accommodate ambiguity in the sequence by programming the
DNA synthesizer to include a mixture of bases at that position. But every such
ambiguity reduces the specificity of the probe. If you allow too much ambiguity
you will have a probe that will react with an unacceptable number of nonspecific clones in the library. One way of reducing the ambiguity of the probe is
to take account of the codon usage of the organism. If this shows that there is a

132

FINDING THE RIGHT CLONE

very marked preference for one codon over another synonymous codon, then
you can use that information in selecting the codon to be included in your
probe. This clearly involves taking a chance, and in many organisms this
preference is not marked enough to be very helpful. Instead, you can reduce
the required ambiguity by careful selection of the region of the amino acid
sequence to be included, so as to avoid amino acids such as leucine, arginine or
serine (with six possible codons) in favour of those amino acids with unique
codons (methionine, tryptophan) or with only two possible codons (e.g. tyrosine, histidine). Oligonucleotides (oligomers) based on reverse-translation deduction are often called guessmers.
To decrease the number of false positives, you can make duplicate lifts from
your library and produce two guessmer probes from different regions. The
chances of a clone giving a false positive signal in both of these is much smaller
than with one. This approach can also be used for the design of PCR primers
for the identification of unknown genes (see Chapter 9).
The process of protein sequencing used to be a difficult one, requiring the
purification of substantial quantities of pure protein, and often failing to yield
a usable amino acid sequence (for technical reasons). Improvements in sequencing technology have made it a more viable option, and it is now possible to
obtain sufficient sequence from a spot eluted from a 2D gel; this is widely used
in surveys of protein expression, especially in conjunction with genome sequence data (see the section on Proteomics, in Chapter 13).

8.2 Screening Expression Libraries with
Antibodies
Libraries made with an expression vector such as lambda gt11 (see Chapter 6)
can be screened with nucleic acid probes as described above. However, such a
library also allows an alternative method of screening, using antibodies (see Box
8.2). For this, the library is cultured at conditions which permit the expression
of fusion proteins. This means growing at 428C, to inactivate the temperaturesensitive repressor, and in the presence of isopropyl galactoside (IPTG), in
order to induce expression from the lacZ promoter. The plates are then overlaid
with a nitrocellulose or nylon filter in the same way as with nucleic acid probe
screening, except the filters are not treated with sodium hydroxide. Instead,
they are incubated with a diluted antibody to the protein in question. This
antibody could have been produced by purifying the protein in question by
biochemical methods and injecting it into an animal such as a rabbit together
with an adjuvant to boost the immune response. Alternatively, a synthetic
peptide could have been produced corresponding to a known or assumed part
of the protein, and used similarly for immunization. It is also possible to use

8.2 SCREENING EXPRESSION LIBRARIES WITH ANTIBODIES

133

Box 8.2 Antibodies
Antibodies are made by animals in response to antigens ± usually proteins or
peptides, for our purposes. If a protein is injected into an animal, the normal
response is to produce a wide range of antibodies (immunoglobulins), which recognize different parts of the protein. The region recognized by an antibody is known as
an epitope. Some antibodies will bind to simple linear epitopes; these are short
sequences of amino acids that can be recognized by a specific antibody, irrespective
of conformation. Many such antibodies will bind to a short synthetic peptide, and if
you use such a peptide to raise antibodies, you will only get antibodies that
recognize linear epitopes. On the other hand, some antibodies raised using a protein
antigen will bind to epitopes that are formed by folding the amino acid chain; these
are known as conformational epitopes. Antibodies that are specific for a conformational epitope will only react with the protein in its native conformation, not with
denatured protein. This is an important distinction. Many procedures in molecular
biology employ denatured protein, so it is important to know that the antibody can
react with a linear epitope. A further consideration is that the protein used to
immunize the animal may have been modified post-translationally ± in particular
it may be glycosylated. Some of the antibodies produced will recognize a glycosylated epitope, and these will be of no use for screening gene libraries.
With antiserum from immunizing an animal, these considerations may not be
crucial. It will contain a mixture of antibodies, and some of these will recognize
linear, non-glycosylated epitopes. A disadvantage is that the antibodies will vary in
specificity ± some will react with proteins other than the one you want. The antiserum may also contain antibodies to other proteins to which the animal has been
exposed. In particular rabbits often have antibodies to E. coli antigens, which is a
problem if you want to detect expression of a recombinant protein in E. coli. It is
therefore necessary to test the specificity of such an antiserum ± and sometimes to
purify it by absorbing out the cross-reacting antibodies.
An alternative would be to isolate and culture individual antibody-producing cells,
so obtaining a single antibody species rather than the mixture you get in an antiserum.
Although antibody-producing cells cannot be maintained in culture, they can be
fused with other cells to form a hybridoma ± a hybrid cell that can be grown as a cell
line and continue to produce a single antibody. This is a monoclonal antibody, i.e. an
antibody made by a single clone of antibody-producing cells. Although monoclonal
antibodies have important applications where specificity is needed (e.g. in diagnosis),
they are not inherently specific. Their specificity arises through testing a lot of clones
to select those that make antibodies that are specific. In molecular biology, this
specificity may be useful, but also can be a disadvantage. If the monoclonal antibody
recognizes a glycosylated or conformational epitope, it will be useless for many of our
applications.
The other advantage of monoclonal antibodies is their constancy. If you use
antiserum from an animal, then once you have used up your supply you have to
immunize another animal. The antiserum will be different ± not only in the antibody
titre, but also in its specificity and in the strength of binding to your antigen. (Larger

134

FINDING THE RIGHT CLONE

animals are better in this respect ± a goat or a sheep can supply antibodies for years
± but they are expensive.) However, a monoclonal antibody is produced from a
permanent cell line. As long as the hybridoma is maintained, you can obtain
supplies of identical antibody.
For detecting a target antigen, you need to label the antibody. In molecular
biology, this label is usually an enzyme, such as horseradish peroxidase. You can
then detect the enzyme using chromogenic or chemiluminescent substrates. However, this would mean having to attach this label to every antibody you used. It is
more convenient to use a second antibody. For example, if the antibody comes from
a rabbit, then you can use a second antibody that reacts with rabbit immunoglobulin (e.g. mouse anti-rabbit IgG is an antibody raised in a mouse that reacts with
rabbit antibodies). A wide range of labelled second antibodies can be bought off the
shelf.

lambda gt11 libraries to identify antigens that have not been characterized, for
example by using antisera from experimentally infected animals, or from
human subjects recovering from an infectious disease. This has proved to be
a very powerful way of identifying those antigens that are especially important
in the natural course of infection, or for protection against infection.
After incubating the filter with the antibody, excess antibody is washed off,
and the filter incubated with a labelled secondary antibody that will bind to the
first one, such as for example anti-rabbit immunoglobulin, allowing detection
of the clones that reacted with the primary antibody (see Box 8.2).
Note the limitations of using antibody screening. In contrast to the use
of nucleic acid probes, where expression is not required, screening a gene library
with antibodies obviously needs expression of the cloned gene ± hence the
common use of a vector such as lambda gt11. Furthermore, the protein
that is expressed in E. coli may not fold into its correct, natural conformation
± especially if you are using a vector like lambda gt11 that generates a
fusion protein. You therefore need an antibody that binds to a linear epitope
(see Box 8.2). In addition, it must recognize a non-glycosylated epitope,
since the protein you are trying to detect will not be correctly glycosylated in
E. coli.
An antiserum derived from immunizing an animal with the purified protein
will contain a variety of different antibodies, some of which will recognize
linear, non-modified epitopes. The problem with conformational or modified
(e.g. glycosylated) epitopes is most likely to occur with monoclonal antibodies
(see Box 8.2), where it is necessary to confirm the nature of the recognized
epitope before using it for screening libraries. Similar considerations arise when
using antibodies for Western blotting (see Chapter 13).

135

8.3 RESCREENING

8.3 Rescreening
As mentioned above, several thousands of recombinants need to be plated in
each culture dish in order to keep the total number of plates reasonably low.
This means that you are unlikely to be able to pick your positive recombinants
pure and uncontaminated by their neighbours the first time around. Instead,
you would lift a small agar plug containing the positive and neighbouring
recombinants and elute them into a buffer. The eluted mixture would then be
replated onto a new plate for rescreening with the same probe or antibody
(Figure 8.6). This serves two purposes. First, it is almost inevitable that some of
the clones are false positives, caused by non-specific binding of probe to the
membrane. Indeed the likelihood of this is sufficiently high that it is common
practice to use two duplicate filters for hybridization; only those clones that
give a positive signal on both filters are regarded as worth following up.
Second, for those that are true positives, the secondary screening will allow
you to pick a recombinant that is free from contaminating neighbours.

FINDING THE RIGHT CLONE

8.4 Subcloning
In subcloning, the recombinant insert is transferred to another vector, almost
invariably a plasmid, which is more amenable for growth, purification, and
analysis. Clearly, if the original vector is a plasmid, subcloning may be unnecessary. However, the plasmid may not be amenable for the downstream experiments that you have in mind, so you may want to reclone the insert, after
verification, into an expression vector(see Chapters 6 and 15). For recombinant
clones with somewhat larger inserts, such as lambda or cosmid clones, it may
be possible to divide the insert up into a set of defined restriction fragments and
clone each of those fragments, or to identify which fragment carries the DNA
that hybridizes to your probe and just clone that fragment into a plasmid
vector.
If the insert is even larger than that, such as those found in yeast and
bacterial artificial chromosomes (YACs and BACs), this approach is likely to
be too time-consuming. Instead you would probably want to fragment the
insert from the selected clone into a number of smaller fragments and produce
a mini-library of those fragments which would then be re-screened in the same
way as the original library (although much more easily).
The first step in subcloning is to grow up enough material. This means either
growing up a sufficient number of E. coli cells carrying the plasmid or
the artificial chromosome, or infecting an E. coli culture with a phage clone.
The purified recombinant vector DNA is then digested with the appropriate
restriction enzyme. In some older vectors, where the insertion site is a single
restriction enzyme recognition site, the insert will be flanked by sites recognized
by that enzyme. The choice is then obvious. However, most commonly
used vectors now have multiple cloning sites, allowing you a lot more flexibility. In particular, if it is important to be able to excise the insert in one piece,
then you will need to be able to use an enzyme that does not cut the insert itself.
For this purpose, you would be likely to choose an enzyme that cuts
DNA infrequently such as NotI, which you can predict is unlikely to have a
recognition site within the insert. On the other hand, if you want to subclone a
smaller piece of the insert, you might choose a medium-frequency cutter
such as EcoRI. After digestion, you would probably separate half of the
reaction mixture by agarose gel electrophoresis (Figure 8.7). This can then be
blotted (see the description of Southern blotting below) and probed with
the same probe you used to screen the library. With the correct DNA fragment
thus identified, you can run out another gel just like the other one, cut out
the DNA fragment, purify it from the agarose, and ligate it to your plasmid
vector.
Artificial chromosome vectors (BAC, PAC) have inserts measuring hundreds of kilobasepairs, making it impractical to digest and separate them. An

Figure 8.7 Sub-cloning a fragment from a recombinant clone

alternative approach for these is shotgun subcloning. This method is based on
random physical shearing of the recombinant vector. The resulting fragments
are cloned into plasmids, transformed into bacteria, and plated. A replica
membrane is then lifted from this plate, and probed with the same probe. In
this way, subclones containing the desired sequence can be identified.

8.5 Characterization of plasmid clones
Whether your clone is produced directly or by subcloning from a larger
fragment from a gene library, at some stage you are certain to want to
characterize the plasmid, and the fragment that it contains. The basic techniques for doing this were described in Chapter 4, so we only need a recapitulation of the major features here. The most basic procedure is to run total DNA
extracts or crude plasmid preparations on an agarose gel and look for a change
in the size of the plasmid compared to the original vector. If the insert is a
reasonable size compared with the vector, you will be able to distinguish
recombinant plasmids (carrying the insert) from the parental vector. However,
you need to be aware that it is not easy to determine the size of the insert
reliably in this way. Conventional size markers are linear DNA fragments,
while the intact plasmid will be a supercoiled circular structure, and will
therefore run differently on the gel.

138

FINDING THE RIGHT CLONE

8.5.1 Restriction digests and agarose
gel electrophoresis
More accurate and more reliable estimates of the size of the insert require some
degree of plasmid purification so that the plasmid can be digested with a
restriction endonuclease. Simple plasmid purification protocols usually depend
on the supercoiled nature of the plasmid: denaturation and rapid renaturation
will result in the plasmid maintaining its natural conformation, while the
linear DNA fragments that are formed by random degradation of the chromosomal DNA will form an insoluble aggregate. Further purification of the
plasmid DNA is obtained by phenol extraction (to remove proteins) and
ethanol precipitation (to remove low molecular weight contaminants) and any
remaining phenol, as well as concentrating the plasmid DNA. There are many
varieties of the procedure, including commercially available kits, which improve
the yield and purity of the resulting material as well as avoiding the need for
phenol extraction.
The purified plasmid can then be digested with an appropriate restriction
enzyme to generate linear fragments that can be accurately sized on an agarose
gel. A common procedure is to use the same enzyme that was involved in
the cloning step. For example, if you have inserted an EcoRI fragment into
a unique EcoRI site on the cloning vector, then digestion with EcoRI will
yield two fragments: one corresponding to the linearized vector, and the second
being the inserted fragment. Using a standard marker containing a set of
linear DNA fragments of known size enable the gel to be calibrated so that
the size of the insert can be determined (within the limits of accuracy of
the system).
Further restriction digestion can be used to verify the construct. If you know
the location of other restriction sites within your cloned fragment, you
can confirm the nature of the insert by additional digests. The use of a site
that is asymmetrically placed within the insert will enable you to check the
orientation of the insert. Figure 8.8 shows an example. In this case, we have
inserted a 4.5 kb EcoRI fragment into the EcoRI site (E) of a 2.5 kb vector
plasmid. The EcoRI digest confirms that both plasmids A and B have a 4.5 kb
insert, but the insert could be either way round. Fortunately, there is a HindIII
site asymmetrically placed within the insert, and another in the vector, adjacent
to the EcoRI site. So a HindIII digest will settle the matter. The gel confirms
that plasmid A yields two HindIII fragments, of 5.5 kb and 1.5 kb, while
plasmid B has the insert in the other orientation, yielding fragments of 3 kb
and 4 kb. Since this is simple to do, it is possible to investigate a number
of colonies to find one in which the insert is the right way round. Ultimately,
however, you will want to use sequence determination to make absolutely
sure.

8.5.2 Southern blots
Further confirmation of the nature of your insert comes, once again, from
hybridization. You cannot hybridize a probe to DNA fragments while they
are in an agarose gel, you need to transfer them to a filter first. The technique
for doing this is one that we have already alluded to: Southern blotting, named
after E.M. Southern who developed it. The basis of the method is illustrated
in Figure 8.9. A membrane (nitrocellulose or, now more commonly, nylonbased) is placed on the gel and a stack of dry paper towels on top of the filter.
Buffer is drawn up through the gel and filter by capillary action, and carries
the DNA fragments with it. They are trapped on the membrane, which
thus acquires a pattern of DNA bands that corresponds to the position
of those fragments in the agarose gel. The arrangement shown in the figure
looks very crude, and there are much more elegant pieces of equipment
available; nevertheless, many molecular biologists prefer to use their own
home-made apparatus. Following transfer of the DNA to the filter, the

relevant DNA fragment can be identified by hybridization in the ways already
described.
Southern blotting is a very useful way of verifying that the band you can see
on a gel is indeed the insert that you have been seeking. However, that is only
the beginning of the applications of Southern blotting. We will come across it
again later on, particularly in Chapters 12 and 16 where it is invaluable for
detecting specific gene fragments in a digest of total chromosomal DNA (which
just looks like a smear if stained with ethidium bromide), and for comparing
the banding patterns obtained with specific probes in DNA from different
strains or different individuals.

8.5.3 PCR and sequence analysis
Usually the sequence of the vector is known. It is therefore simple to design a
pair of primers that will hybridize to a region at either side of the cloning site,
and use these primers to PCR amplify a fragment containing the inserted DNA
(see Chapter 9). In this case there is no need to purify the plasmid DNA from
each recombinant clone. You can simply resuspend a portion of the colony in
water and boil it. PCR amplification will then produce a product of a characteristic size, if you have cloned the right piece of DNA. You can screen a
substantial number of potential recombinants in this way. Once you have

8.5 CHARACTERIZATION OF PLASMID CLONES

141

found one that does produce the correct size of product in the PCR, you can
determine the sequence of the PCR product to confirm the nature of the insert.
If you are more confident about the nature of your recombinant product ±
for example if you are simply re-cloning a known fragment rather than recovering a recombinant from a library, you can skip the PCR step and simply
carry out sequencing on purified plasmid DNA from the chosen colony.

9 Polymerase
Chain Reaction
(PCR)
On 10 December 1993, Kary B Mullis received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry
from King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden for his invention of the polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) method. Mullis had published and patented his invention
only eight years earlier, in 1985. The same year, the Physiology and Medicine
prize was awarded to Richard J Roberts and Phillip A Sharp, for their independent discovery of split genes. These laureates had waited twice as long, 16
years, since their fundamental discovery, made in 1977. This will give you some
idea of the immense impact PCR has had. Although it is (as we shall see) quite a
simple method with obvious limitations, the applications of this method have
revolutionized both basic and applied biology. This has been dramatically
illustrated in forensic science, where numerous old open cases have been
solved, and in clinical applications, where it has suddenly become possible to
make diagnoses in hours that previously took weeks.
The key factor in transforming the initial method into one that could have
such an impact was the introduction of a thermostable DNA polymerase called
Taq polymerase. It was originally isolated from Thermophilus aquaticus, a
thermophilic archaebacterium that thrives in hot springs at temperatures
close to the boiling point of water. As a result, all enzymes in this organism
have evolved to withstand high temperatures where all proteins from most
other organisms would denature immediately and irreversibly. Apart from this
distinct feature, Taq polymerase (not to be confused with TaqI, a restriction
enzyme from the same species) is a normal DNA polymerase. It will synthesize
a new DNA strand complementary to a single-stranded DNA template. Like
all other DNA polymerases, it requires a primer, a more or less short strand of
complementary DNA to start its synthesis from. In fact, as we will see, it is not
a particularly good DNA polymerase. Although it has high processivity (which
means it adds successive nucleotides without dissociating from the DNA), it
lacks proofreading activity, so it is unable to correct erroneously incorporated
nucleotide bases.
PCR uses Taq polymerase (or other thermostable DNA polymerases that are
now available) for the exponential amplification of a DNA fragment from a

144

POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION (PCR)

longer template, which could be as long as a whole chromosome. The amplified
fragment is defined by two short synthetic oligonucleotides that are complementary to the opposing DNA strands of the template that is being amplified.
This introduces another limitation to the method. You must know the sequence for at least part of the DNA molecule you wish to amplify ± or at
least you must be able to make an educated guess.
So how do we go from a small amount of, say, total human genomic DNA to
a large amount of one short region that has been exponentially amplified to the
extent that it entirely dominates the reaction mixture? This will be clear if you
go through the first few cycles in a PCR amplification.

9.1 The PCR Reaction
In this example, we will be starting with genomic DNA purified from human
leukocytes. The preparation will contain more or less sheared chromosome
segments. Only a small amount is required even from such a complex template
± in fact, as little as a single cell has been used as starting material.
We will also need two primers. These can be synthesized to your specifications from a specialist supplier at a very low cost within a day or two. In this
example, we will replicate the work of Mullis and his colleagues and use
primers flanking a region for the human b-globin gene that is mutated in sickle
cell anaemia. A very considerable excess of primer molecules is added to the
reaction. (This of course refers to an excess in molar, or molecular, terms; since
the primer is very much smaller than the template, the amount of primer by
weight is quite low ± see the discussion in Chapter 5.)
The binding, annealing, of the primer to the template is a typical DNA:DNA
hybridization reaction, and follows similar principles to the hybridization of
probes as described in Chapter 8. First, the double-stranded template needs to
be denatured. The temperature used for this in PCR, 948C, does not do much
damage to the Taq polymerase molecule during the minute or so that the PCR
reaction is heated to this temperature.
The temperature is then lowered to the optimal annealing temperature,
where the two primers can bind to the opposing DNA strands (Figure 9.1).
This is the only temperature in a PCR cycle that can be varied widely. Thus it
can be optimized for maximum binding of the primer to the correct template,
and minimum binding to other sequences. If the annealing temperature is too
low, the primers will bind at other positions on the template, resulting in false
products or no product at all. If the annealing temperature is too high, the
primers may fail to bind at the correct site. The temperature needed will depend
on the sequence and length of the primers. Since G±C pairing is stronger than
A±T, the more Gs and Cs there are in the primer, the stronger it will bind (and

therefore higher annealing temperatures can be used). (See Chapter 8 for a
discussion of other factors that influence the optimal annealing temperature.)
Although computer programs are available to predict the optimal annealing
temperature for a primer, in practice a certain amount of trial and error is
needed. Normally, the annealing temperature is chosen somewhere between 40
and 608C, although for templates with a high GC content annealing temperatures as high as 728C (the normal extension temperature, see below) may be
used. Note also that, as with hybridization, we may want to use conditions that
will allow priming from sites that are only partially matched to the primers, and
for this purpose we would use a lower annealing temperature. Since the primers
are small, and at relatively high molar concentrations, annealing is rapid,
taking only a minute or less.
The temperature is then raised to approximately 728C, which is normally the
optimum extension temperature for a PCR reaction. The Taq polymerase will
now produce complementary DNA strands starting from the primers. The
extension proceeds at approximately 1000 bases per minute.

146

POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION (PCR)

Because the template in this case is many times larger than that, the polymerization will proceed until it is interrupted. This happens when the temperature is
yet again raised to 948 in order to start the next cycle in the PCR reaction, which
is normally identical in temperature and duration to the previous ones. As we
finish the first PCR cycle, we note that we have two double-stranded DNA
molecules for each one that we started with. Each one contains one strand of the
original template, and one novel strand which is defined at one end, specifically,
by the oligonucleotide primer and at the other end, non-specifically, by the time
we allowed for extension.
The advantage of Taq DNA polymerase over, say, E coli DNA polymerase
will now become apparent. The E coli polymerase could have done the extension, although it operates at 378C which means that you would not be able to
increase stringency and would risk non-specific hybridization. Above all, however, you would lose all enzyme activity in the denaturation step, and would
have to add fresh enzyme. (In the initial manifestation of PCR, before the
introduction of Taq, this is precisely what had to be done.) Taq polymerase, by
contrast, survives the denaturation step unscathed.
This second denaturation step creates four single-stranded template molecules. At the following annealing step, one molecule of the complementary
primer will bind to each of these single strands. As the temperature is again
raised to 728C, Taq polymerase will begin to extend the primers (Figure 9.2).
Two of the four extensions, where the primer has again bound to the original
chromosomal template, are identical to the first extension in that they terminate only when the temperature is raised. Note, however, that this does not
apply to the two strands that are produced with the new strands as templates.
These templates end abruptly where the opposite primers had bound.
If you envisage the next cycle, then again the two original template strands
will give rise to a long product, limited only by the duration of the extension
reaction. Priming on all the other strands will yield a product that is defined
and delimited by the primers at both ends. Each subsequent cycle will produce
two new long strands, but the number of new short strands made will increase
exponentially, so that eventually the reaction mixture will be completely dominated by the newly formed short DNA strands with one primer at each end.
It follows from this that the ends of the new DNA are actually defined by
the primers, unlike the intervening regions which are entirely defined by the
original template (apart from any mistakes in the amplification).
This means that if the sequence of the primer is in any way different from the
template, this will not be apparent in the final product, where the ends will be
the sequences of the primers not that of the original template. This in turn
means that modifications can be introduced through the primers. One particularly useful application of this principle is in the addition of restriction enzyme

recognition sites to the ends of a PCR product, to make it easier to clone. In
order to do this (Figure 9.3), the 5H ends of the primer sequences are modified to
incorporate the appropriate recognition site. In the first PCR cycle, the 5H ends
of the primer will not pair with the template, but that does not prevent the
annealing or extension steps. (It is essential for the 3H end of the primer to be a
perfect match, but not the 5H end). In subsequent rounds, the part of the primer
carrying the restriction site (which is now incorporated into the product) will be
accurately replicated, so the primers are now a perfect match. The end product
is a DNA fragment carrying the restriction site near the ends, so it can be cut
with the restriction enzyme and ligated with an appropriate vector.
The same principle can be employed to introduce other modifications into
the product, including base changes. Attaching fluorescent dyes, or other
labels, to one or both primers provides a good way of obtaining a labelled
product.

9.2 PCR in Practice
During the initial stages of its development, PCR was performed by manually
transferring tubes between thermostat-controlled water baths. It was obvious
that this was not desirable for the reproducibility of the reaction (nor for the
mental well-being of the operator). Therefore, the launching of PCR as a
revolutionary new technology was associated with the development of the
programmable thermocycler. These instruments are based on metal heating
blocks with holes for the PCR tubes. These blocks are designed to switch
between the programmed series of temperature steps with great speed and
precision by a combination of heating and cooling systems. The use of small
(0.2±0.5 m), thin-walled, tubes helps to ensure a rapid change of temperature.
Alternatively, for larger numbers of samples, microtitre trays are used.

9.2 PCR IN PRACTICE

149

Because the PCR reaction is performed in a small volume (typically 25±50 ml),
and because of the high temperatures involved, it can be easily imagined that the
water would quickly evaporate and end up on the inside of the lid rather than on
the bottom of the tube. There are two ways of preventing this: the first one is to
place a drop of mineral oil over the reaction; an alternative, and less messy,
approach is to heat the lids of the tubes to prevent condensation.

9.2.1 Optimization of the PCR reaction
The importance of the annealing temperature in PCR has already been discussed. If the temperature is too high, binding of the primers to the target will
not be stable enough for amplification to take place. If it is too low, the system
will become too tolerant of partial primer-target mismatches, and will therefore
be non-specific.
The most important PCR parameter by far is the design of the primers. The
primers must be chosen to define a target of appropriate length. As far as
possible, complementarity to other targets in the template mix should be
avoided. To a degree, this can be pre-empted by database searches of putative
sequences, but often it is, at least in part, a matter of trial and error. The primers
should also not anneal to themselves or to one another, and should be unable to
form stable secondary structures. Computer programs are available to check
that the chosen sequences are suitable in these respects.
Just as conserved gene regions can be used to create `guessmers' for library
screening, they can also be used to create degenerate pools of PCR primers. In
this way, if two regions within a gene are known or can be predicted by an
educated guess, it is often possible to amplify a novel gene by this method. This
can be used for the cloning of a known gene from another species, or for
discovering a novel gene that is related to one that is previously known (see
later in this chapter). It is of course important to remember that the flanking
sequences of the product are determined by the primer and not by the template.
Another important factor is the concentration of magnesium ions, a necessary cofactor for the enzyme. A higher magnesium concentration gives a higher
yield, but also a lower specificity.

9.2.2 Analysis of PCR products
The normal way of analysing the products of a PCR reaction is to run out the
samples in an agarose electrophoresis gel. This allows the user to ascertain that
only one band is obtained in each reaction, which is usually the objective. By
comparing the size of the amplified band to a molecular weight standard, it is
also possible to ascertain that the molecular weight is the same as the predicted

150

POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION (PCR)

one (which is usually known). The assumption is that if the band is the
predicted size, then it probably corresponds to the predicted fragment ± an
assumption which occasionally leads you down the wrong track. If the result is
important, it is worth checking the identity of the band (see below).
On the other hand, you may get a band of a different size from that
predicted. Frequently a specific amplification product (of the correct size) is
found together with a strong band of low molecular weight. These low molecular weight bands are called primer dimers, and are caused by binding of
the primers to each other. They can usually be ignored, although the tendency
of primers to form dimers can cause problems with a PCR, due (amongst other
things) to competition between primer±primer and primer±template binding.
Another effect may be an amplification that appears to be specific (as shown by
the absence of a band of that size in control reactions), but gives a product of
the wrong size. This may indicate that one, or both, of the primers is binding at
a different position, producing an artefactual product. This may also be
manifested as a specific band together with a more or less complex mixture
of non-specific ones. In these cases, greater specificity may be obtained by
adjusting one or more of the PCR parameters (see the previous section).
Alternatively, nested PCR may be used to increase the specificity (and/or the
sensitivity) of the PCR. In nested PCR (Figure 9.4), a small aliquot of the
original reaction is transferred to a second, `nested' PCR reaction. In the nested

PCR reaction, one or both primers are replaced with a second set of primers
which will bind specifically within the desired amplification product. In this
way, the undesirable ones which have typically been amplified because of a
coincidental sequence similarity in the region of the original primers, will
normally disappear.
In order to provide another level of certainly about the identity of a PCR
product, in particular if the exact molecular weight is not known, the gel may
be blotted and hybridized (see Chapter 8) with a probe complementary to the
expected product. Alternatively, because of the remarkable recent progress in
sequencing technology, many people find it faster, easier, and cheaper to
perform direct sequencing on the PCR product (see Chapter 10).

9.3 Cloning PCR Products
Although PCR is commonly used merely to detect the presence of a specific
sequence in different templates, it is also often employed for the amplification
of such sequences as a convenient way of obtaining a specific product for
cloning. This is especially important when the starting material is very scarce,
as in such cases the conventional routes (for example constructing and
screening a gene library) are impossible.
You might expect, from the description so far, that the PCR products would
be blunt-ended, and could therefore be cloned by normal blunt-ended cloning
(see Chapter 5). In practice, this is often not very successful. Not only is bluntended cloning comparatively inefficient, compared with cloning sticky-ended
fragments, but also, as described below, Taq polymerase often tends to add a
non-specific adenosine residue to the 3H ends of the product. The product is
therefore not blunt-ended, and cloning with a blunt-ended vector will fail. Even
the use of linkers (see Chapter 5) will be unsuccessful in this situation.
One way round this has already been alluded to. This is to use a modified
primer that contains an additional restriction enzyme recognition site in its 5H
end. The resulting products can be cut and ligated to a plasmid that has been
cut with the same enzyme, with great efficiency (Figure 9.5). This is particularly
useful when cloning larger PCR fragments.
An alternative, commonly used, method is so-called TA cloning, which takes
advantage of the propensity of Taq polymerase to non-specifically add an
adenosine to the 3H ends of each new DNA fragment. This is exploited by using
a linearized vector plasmid which has been engineered to contain a thymidine
overhang at each end. This produces short, but still sticky ends which will
anneal, allowing quite efficient ligation (see Figure 9.5, and also Chapter 5).
Note, however, that not all polymerases add adenosine residues to the product;
the `proof-reading' polymerases produce genuinely blunt-ended PCR products.

A further improvement to PCR cloning technology is the use of Vaccinia
virus DNA topoisomerase I (TOPO) (see also Chapter 5). In vivo, topoisomerases are involved in the supercoiling/relaxation of circular DNA. They
will cleave DNA at specific sites, leaving a sticky end. The energy released by
breaking the phosphodiester bond is stored in a covalent bond between
the enzyme and one of the cleaved strands. The enzyme trapped in the stickyend will then rapidly and efficiently release its stored energy into the formation
of a new phosphodiester band as soon as the sticky end encounters its complementary partner. Thus, TOPO has both endonuclease and ligase activity.
Commercially available TOPO vectors offer sticky-end overhangs, ranging
from TA cloning to more complex sequences bound to the TOPO enzyme.
This makes for rapid and ligase-free cloning.

9.4 Long-range PCR
We have already discussed the fact that Taq polymerase lacks proofreading
activity and is therefore unable to correct its own errors. These errors occur
approximately once per 9000 nucleotides, on average. These mistakes will then
be perpetuated in all new molecules that have been created by the amplification
of these ones. If direct sequencing is used, this is not really a problem, because

the defects will be randomly distributed and the vast majority of molecules will
be correct in any given position. However, if the PCR products are cloned it
will potentially be a problem, because any error in one molecule will be
perpetuated in all the offspring of that one clone (Figure 9.6). For this reason,
investigators normally sequence at least three PCR clones in order to ensure
that they are identical.
Another consequence of the relative sloppiness of Taq polymerase is the fact
that Taq polymerase can only efficiently amplify fragments of a few thousand
base pairs. Both these problems can be solved by the introduction of thermostable DNA polymerases from other thermophilic organisms, such as Pfu and
Pwo DNA polymerases. Unlike Taq polymerase, these enzymes do have proofreading activity. They are not necessarily as efficient, however. This has been
ingeniously overcome by the introduction of proprietary mixtures of Taq and
proofreading DNA polymerases. By combining proofreading and high yield,
these mixtures allow the efficient amplification of DNA fragments as large
as 50 kb.

9.5 Reverse-transcription PCR
In Chapter 7 we described the use of reverse transcriptase to obtain a cDNA
copy of mRNA, and the construction of cDNA libraries. Combining reverse

154

POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION (PCR)

transcription (RT) with PCR, a procedure known as RT±PCR, extends the
application of PCR into the analysis of gene expression, either qualitatively or
quantitatively, as well as greatly facilitating the construction of cDNA libraries
or the cloning of specific cDNAs. The use of RT±PCR for the analysis of gene
expression is described in Chapter 13.
One problem with RT±PCR is that the initial mRNA preparation is likely to
be contaminated with DNA. The PCR step can then result in amplification of
the contaminating DNA even if no mRNA was present (and hence no cDNA
produced by reverse transcription). When working with eukaryotic material,
this can often be overcome by designing primers using sequences from adjacent
exons. In this way, amplification of any genomic DNA will either be prevented
altogether (because the presence of the intervening intron makes the sequence
too large to be amplified under the chosen conditions), or readily distinguished
from amplification of cDNA (because of the different size of the product).
Otherwise, it is necessary to remove all traces of DNA from the mRNA,
usually by treatment with DNase. This in turn creates further problems. The
DNase has to be removed before the reverse transcription step. It is also
important to avoid any contamination of the DNase with RNase, which
would destroy any mRNA Ribonuclease is a very stable enzyme, not destroyed
by heat, so it used to be very difficult to remove it without also destroying the
DNase. Fortunately there are now commercial preparations of DNase that are
free of ribonuclease, and these are now sufficiently reliable to be used for this
purpose. However, it is essential that you use an RNase-free DNase rather than
the cheaper grades.

9.6 Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE)
The procedure described in Chapter 7 for generating cDNA suffers from the
problem that the products are often incomplete, i.e. the ends of the mRNA
molecules are under-represented in the clones generated. In Chapter 7 we
considered ways of at least partially overcoming this problem, using random
priming and tailing with terminal transferase. PCR provides further enhancement of these techniques, by specifically amplifying the ends of mRNA
molecules.
The method known as rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) is based on
the amplification between a gene-specific primer (GSP) within a known area,
and a universal primer at either end of the cDNA molecule. Note that the use of
a gene-specific primer is only possible if you already know, or can in some way
infer, the sequence of at least a small part of the gene.
The most straightforward type is 3H RACE (Figure 9.7), which allows amplification of cDNA corresponding to the 3H end of the mRNA. As in the
description of cDNA synthesis in Chapter 7, this method takes advantage of

the fact that eukaryotic mRNA has a poly-A tail. This tail is used as the binding
site for a complementary, universal oligo-dT primer, for synthesis of the first
cDNA strand. For 3H RACE, this primer has an additional sequence, known as
an anchor, which provides a more effective site for subsequent amplification
(and often includes a restriction site to assist in subsequent cloning). The
second cDNA strand is initiated from a gene-specific primer. The resulting
double-stranded DNA can then be amplified by the usual PCR procedures,
using the original primers, or replacing the oligo-dT-anchor primer with one
just containing the anchor sequence.
Normally, PCR would use two specific primers. In the basic 3H RACE system,
as shown in Figure 9.7 , one primer (the GSP) is specific for the gene concerned,
while the other primer (the oligo-dT-anchor primer) will act as primer for any
polyadenylated mRNA. The specificity of the system can be enhanced by a
nested PCR in which further amplification takes place using a second, nested
primer (also specific for the gene in question) in place of the GSP.

156

POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION (PCR)

In a similar way, 5H RACE enables amplification of cDNA corresponding to
the 5H end of the mRNA. The key feature of this procedure is the incorporation
of a universal tag at the 3H end of all first strand cDNA molecules. This is
accomplished by the enzyme terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, usually
known ± unsurprisingly ± as terminal transferase or TdT. This enzyme will
non-specifically add deoxynucleotides to the 3H end of a single DNA strand. By
making only one dNTP available, for example deoxycytosine, a 5H tail analogous to the 3H poly-A tail can be added.
In the procedure shown in Figure 9.8, the mRNA is initially reverse transcribed using random primers, which are more likely to produce first strand
cDNA corresponding to the 5H ends of the mRNA than using oligo-dT primers.
This is a non-specific step, and will produce a mixture of single-stranded cDNA
molecules, ideally reflecting all the mRNA present in the original material. The

cDNA pool is then tailed with terminal transferase, to provide a binding site
for an oligo-dG primer coupled to an anchor sequence, for second-strand
cDNA synthesis. This is then followed by PCR amplification, using the anchor
primer and a gene-specific primer. As with 3H RACE, additional specificity can
be gained by using nested PCR, with a second specific primer replacing the first
GSP.
Thus, even if a gene is novel, PCR can be used to obtain the entire cDNA
sequence without ever using a vector-based library. This has made many laboratories abandon cDNA library screening altogether, although it is currently
experiencing a revival thanks to the development of array libraries from national genome facilities.

9.7 Applications of PCR
9.7.1 PCR cloning strategies
PCR can be used in several ways to provide alternatives to the screening of
random libraries as described in Chapters 7 and 8. For example, analysis of
the known sequences of a set of related genes may show that although the
genes are not similar enough to devise reliable hybridization probes, there
may be some regions that are relatively highly conserved. It is possible to
construct pairs of primers directed at these conserved regions, and use these
to amplify the corresponding fragment from the genomic DNA of your
target organism (Figure 9.9). Nested PCR is often used to add to the
power of this approach. You can then sequence this product, to try to
confirm that it is indeed derived from the correct gene, and you can use it
as a probe for screening a gene library to isolate clones carrying the complete
gene.
This approach needs to be treated carefully. One reason part of a gene may
be highly conserved is that it codes for an essential substrate-binding site, so
any gene which uses the same substrate is likely to have a similar sequence. For
example, many enzymes that use ATP as a substrate have a similar sequence
that represents the ATP-binding site. Therefore, other methods have to be used
to determine the real function of your novel gene.
On the other hand, if you already know the sequence of the gene, then you
can devise a reliable PCR system to amplify the whole gene or part of it,
whether from genomic DNA or cDNA, and either clone or sequence the
product. Cloning and/or sequencing a gene of which you already know the
sequence is much more useful than it sounds. For example, you may want to
know whether the sequence varies at all in different strains (see Chapter 12).
PCR amplification and sequencing provides a quick route to answering that

question. It is also employed in medical genetics in the search for individual
sequence differences which may cause disease.
Alternatively, you may have cloned a gene in one vector and you then
want to re-clone it in a different plasmid ± perhaps moving it into an expression
vector, or removing extraneous DNA that was present in the original clone
from a random gene library. You can easily devise a pair of primers that
will produce exactly the product you want ± down to adjusting the reading
frame to fit in with your expression vector (see Chapter 13), or adding or
removing restriction sites at the end of the fragment to aid subsequent manipulation.
In Chapter 15, we discuss the introduction of changes into the coding
sequence of a gene (site-directed mutagenesis); PCR plays a major role in this
as well. A further topic in Chapter 15 is the use of a procedure known as

9.7

APPLICATIONS OF PCR

159

assembly PCR for assembling synthetic genes. There is virtually no end to the
versatility of the procedures to which you can adapt PCR as an aid to cloning
and re-cloning DNA fragments in a research laboratory.

9.7.2 Analysis of recombinant clones and rare events
The best way of characterizing a recombinant clone, to make sure you have
indeed produced the structure that you intended, is to sequence it ± or at least
to sequence across the new junctions that have been made. For this, you can
either directly sequence the appropriate part of the recombinant plasmid, or
you can amplify across the inserted fragment and sequence the PCR product.
PCR can also be used to detect specific events that occur in vivo, without
having to clone the affected region of the genome. For example, if we want to
detect the transposition of an insertion sequence into a specific site, or if we
want to test if our gene knockouts (see Chapter 17) have really inserted a
foreign DNA fragment into that site, we can use PCR. We would use one
primer directed at the insert and one at the genomic flanking sequence. We
would only get a product if the event we are looking for has indeed occurred.
Otherwise the two primers are binding to completely different bits of DNA.
However, this needs a word of caution which applies to some extent in many
applications of PCR. The technique is splendid for amplifying DNA where a
genuine target exists. When there is no genuine target, there is the possibility of
artefacts being created, due to the power of the technique for amplifying
extremely rare events, such as the possibility of the polymerase `jumping'
from one DNA molecule to another. This may seem highly unlikely (although
there are reports of it happening) ± but it only needs to happen once, in the
early stages, and the product produced will then be amplified fully effectively,
leading to an incorrect conclusion.
A similar effect can occur if the template contains a stable hairpin (or stemloop) structure. This will cause the polymerase to pause (or even to stop
altogether). However, while it is paused, it may encounter the other side of
the hairpin and `jump' across ± yielding a product that lacks the hairpin.
Although this rarely happens, the product will then amplify much more effectively than the original template, and the final product will be shorter than it
should be, leading to the suggestion that your strain contains a deletion at that
point.

9.7.3 Diagnostic applications
The polymerase chain reaction has many important practical applications of
PCR (i.e. in the real world outside molecular biology laboratories). Amongst

160

POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION (PCR)

these are forensic applications ± the detection and identification of specific
DNA fragments that can be traced to a particular individual ± and uses in
medical diagnostics, including the detection of mutations causing human genetic diseases. PCR can be employed for the detection of pathogenic microorganisms, especially those which are difficult to culture, and in particular it plays
a central role in the detection of many viruses, such as HIV. In these contexts,
the problem of contamination has to be taken very seriously. The ability of
PCR to amplify tiny amounts of DNA makes it an extremely sensitive test, but
it also makes it extremely sensitive to low levels of contaminating DNA. In a
diagnostic situation, extensive measures have to be taken to avoid contamination, notably the use of separate rooms and equipment for the preparation of
the clean (pre-PCR amplification) material and the analysis of the post-PCR
products (which contain large amounts of material that can act as template for
further amplification. A battery of additional precautions must be taken,
including the use of negative controls with each batch of samples. We will
look at some of these applications further in later chapters.
For some applications, it is desirable (or even necessary) to be able to use
PCR not merely to detect a specific template, but to determine how much of it is
present. The best methods for quantitative PCR are collectively known as realtime PCR, since you can monitor the accumulation of product during the
reaction, rather than merely assaying it at the end. This also has advantages
in diagnostic applications, since a result is obtained much more quickly. Realtime PCR is described more fully in Chapter 13.

10 DNA Sequencing
In 1975, the first complete DNA genome was sequenced ± that of the small
bacteriophage ùX174 (5 kb). Other complete sequences followed gradually,
including the SV40 virus (5 kb, 1977), human mitochondrial DNA (16 kb,
1981), bacteriophage lambda (49 kb, 1982) and the Epstein±Barr virus, containing 170 kb of DNA (1984). A new dimension was opened up in 1995 by the first
sequence of the genome of an independently living organism, that of the
bacterium Haemophilus influenzae, which is ten times larger (1800 kb). Only
six years later, in February 2001, two competing entities, the publicly funded
Human Genome Project and the private company Celera, published the human
genome sequence of no less than three billion base pairs. On the way, we have
seen the complete genomic sequences of important model organisms such as E.
coli, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the fruit fly Drosophila, and the plant
Arabidopsis. All of these have been received with great excitement and interest in
the media, especially of course the human genome sequence ± not least because
of the rivalry and acrimony between the two consortia involved, and the failed
attempts at co-operation. From a scientific point of view, these projects are
obviously revolutionary. They are also themselves the result of a technical
revolution ± the development of sophisticated high-throughput sequencing
technology.
Sequencing is the primary way of characterizing a macromolecule, whether it
be determining the order of amino acids in a protein or of bases in a nucleic
acid. Protein sequencing was a very important tool before genes could be
cloned and sequenced. With the advent of recombinant DNA technology,
however, it was superseded by the much more efficient method of DNA
sequencing, with the sequence of the encoded protein being deduced from the
sequence of the gene. Although direct protein sequencing is currently experiencing a renaissance, this chapter is dedicated to the sequencing of DNA.

10.1 Principles of DNA Sequencing
The most fundamental way of analysing the structure of DNA, whether it is a
recombinant plasmid, a natural gene, or a whole genome, is to determine the

162

DNA SEQUENCING

sequence of bases of which it is composed. The advent of automated DNA
sequencing machines has made the determination of the sequence of individual
fragments very much faster and more reliable, and the dramatic increase in the
available computer power has enabled the assembly of very large numbers of
fragments (as well as the analysis of very large sequences) ± but at the same time
the underlying principle of the sequencing method remains the same.
The principle of this procedure, known as dideoxy sequencing or the Sanger
method, is illustrated in Figure 10.1. (It should be noted that there is an
alternative procedure, known as the Maxam±Gilbert method, which works
by selective chemical degradation. This is no longer in common use for routine
sequencing, and will not be described here.) To understand the dideoxy procedure it is necessary to remember two fundamental facts about DNA synthesis: first, synthesis of a DNA strand does not start from scratch. It requires a

primer annealed to the template strand. Synthesis of the new strand works by
adding bases to the primer that are complementary to the template. So by using
a primer that will bind to a specific position on the template we can ensure that
all the new DNA that is made starts from the same point. Second, the addition
of bases to the growing strand occurs by formation of a covalent phosphodiester
bond between the 5H -phosphate on the nucleotide to be added and the 3H -OH
group on the existing molecule. The substrate for this reaction is a 5H -dNTP, i.e.
a deoxynucleotide with three phosphates at the 5H -position of the deoxyribose
sugar; two of these phosphates are eliminated in the reaction.
The sugar part of the natural substrate is more specifically a 2H -deoxyribose,
i.e. it does not have a hydroxyl group at the 2H -position (this distinguishes it
from the ribose sugars that occur in RNA). However, it does have a 3H -OH
group, which is necessary for the formation of the next phosphodiester bond
when the next base is incorporated. What happens if we use, instead of the
natural substrate, one in which there is no 3H -OH group, i.e. a 2H ,3H -dideoxy
derivative, a ddNTP (see Figure 10.2)? This can be incorporated into the DNA,
by formation of a phosphodiester bond between its 5H -phosphate and the 3H -OH
on the previous residue. However, that reaction produces a strand which does
not have a 3H -OH at the end, and so no further bases can be added. DNA
synthesis will therefore terminate at that point.
So if we replace one of the dNTPs with a dideoxy derivative ± for example we
use a mixture of dGTP, dCTP and dGTP (the normal substrates) but replace
dATP with the 2H ,3H -dideoxy derivative which we will label ddATP ± then DNA
synthesis will proceed only as far as the first A residue and will then stop
(Figure 10.3). If we carry out a set of four such reactions, in each case replacing
one of the dNTPs with its corresponding ddNTP, we would produce four
molecules of different lengths, each proceeding just as far as the first occurrence
of the relevant nucleotide in the sequence.
Just determining the first occurrence of each base would not be much use.
However, instead of completely replacing, say, dATP with ddATP, we can use

a mixture of the two substrates. So at the first T residue in the template, a few
molecules of the new strand will have ddA added (and will therefore terminate)
but most will have the normal A residue, and the reaction will be able to
proceed. At the next T in the template, some more molecules will terminate,
and so on. We will thus have a series of molecules of different chain lengths,
each ending with ddA (see Figure 10.1). These can be separated by electrophoresis in a polyacrylamide gel, using denaturing conditions to prevent the
DNA strands from folding up. We also use a gel that is much thinner and
longer than normal acrylamide gels. This increases the resolving power of the
gel so that it can resolve differences in length as small as a single base. The
molecules are separated on the basis of their size, with the smaller molecules
running faster through the gel. We therefore get a series of bands, corresponding to the positions of A residues in the new strand (or T residues in the
template). With a set of four reactions, each using a different ddNTP, we get
a set of four lanes, from which the sequence can be read as shown in the figure.
For manual DNA sequencing, we would normally carry out the reaction
with one of the dNTPs radioactively labelled, so that exposure of the gel to

O base

an X-ray film would result in a pattern of black bands on the film. Because
the smallest fragments (which are closest to the primer) will migrate faster,
they will be at the bottom of the gel; the gel is therefore read from bottom to
top.

10.2 Automated Sequencing
Today, virtually all DNA sequencing uses automated sequencers. Although the
principle is the same, the method of detection is different. For automated
sequencing, either the primer or the ddNTPs are labelled by incorporation of
a fluorescent dye. Thus, rather than running the gel for a finite time and
reading the result, the machine uses a laser to read the fluorescence of the
dye as the bands pass a fixed point. Much longer sequences can be read from
each track in this way. A further advantage is that the sequence read by the
machine is fed automatically into a computer. This is not only much quicker
than reading a gel manually and typing the resulting sequence into a computer,
but also avoids the errors that are virtually inescapable with manual data entry.
For larger scale genome sequencing projects, the processes of sample preparation, setting up the sequencing reactions, and loading the products into the
sequencer, are also automated, using robotic methods.
If the primer is labelled, all the products carry the same dye, and so you still
have to use four lanes. However, if the four ddNTPs are each labelled with
different dyes, the sequencing reactions can be performed in a single tube and
separated in a single lane, thus increasing the capacity of the machine. A further
development on this is to replace the polyacrylamide gel, which needs to be cast
anew for each run, with a reusable matrix-filled capillary. Apart from the
development of supervectors which allow the cloning of very large DNA
fragments (see Chapter 6) and the enormous increase in computer power, it is
this development of simplified automatic sequencers, where sample preparations and sample loading are performed by robots, that have made possible
the sequencing of eukaryotic genomes such as the human one. The strategies
for large-scale genome sequencing are considered later in this chapter.
Both manual and automated DNA sequencing methods suffer from problems that can give rise to errors in the sequence. These are often associated with
the presence of certain combinations of bases in the DNA ± for example runs of
identical nucleotides, when it can be difficult to determine exactly how many
bases there are in the run, and the presence of secondary structures in the DNA
such as hairpin loops, which can interfere either with DNA synthesis (causing
premature termination) or with the running of the fragment on the gel. Some of
these potential errors can be identified and minimized by altering the reaction
conditions, by sequencing a different overlapping fragment covering the problem region, and by determining the sequence of the complementary strand.

166

DNA SEQUENCING

A good complete sequence will therefore be derived by reading and assembling
several overlapping sequences in each direction.

10.3 Extending the Sequence
Although automated DNA sequencers allow much longer reads than manual
methods, the length of sequence that can be obtained from a single run is still
limited. As the fragments get larger the degree of separation between the bands
is less, and the amount of product in each band is reduced, making the signal
weaker. (In addition to the required termination due to incorporation of
dideoxynucleotides, synthesis may pause or even stop for other reasons, such
as secondary structure in the DNA.) The sequence thus becomes progressively
less reliable. Sometimes this is not a problem: if we are using sequencing to
verify the structure of a recombinant plasmid that we have made, or if we are
looking at the variation of a specific region between different strains, then the
sequence of a few hundred bases may be quite sufficient. However, if we want
to sequence a whole gene, or especially a whole genome, then we will usually
require longer sequence data.
One strategy for extending the length of sequence determined is referred to as
walking (Figure 10.4). Remember that the sequence depends on DNA synthesis
starting from a specific primer. Usually, with an unknown cloned sequence, we
would start with a primer directed at the cloning vector close to the point of
insertion. Since most sequencing projects use the same cloning vector (either a
pUC plasmid or an M13 vector, which have the same sequence flanking the
cloning site), we can use the same primers for any clone. These are therefore
known as universal primers.

The (forward) primer from one side of the insert will read the sequence in one
direction, while the sequence of the complementary strand will be obtained
using the (reverse) primer from the other side of the insert. The sequence we
obtain would thus start with a small amount of vector sequence (which has to
be removed prior to analysis or to deposition in a databank, see below) and
would then read through into the unknown insert. We can extend the length
of sequence determined by using the first piece of data to design a new
primer that would start synthesis further along the insert. That will produce
a further length of sequence, which can then be used to design a third primer,
and so on. This procedure is quite effective for relatively short sequences
but becomes excessively tedious if long stretches of DNA are to be sequenced.
It can, however, be a useful strategy for finishing larger sequences (such as
whole genome sequences) when other approaches have left short gaps (see
below).

10.4 Shotgun Sequencing; Contig Assembly
For sequencing a longer fragment ± say a cloned fragment of 10 kb ± the
best procedure is to split it up into smaller fragments, each of which is a
suitable size for sequencing. This is like producing a gene library. The insert
from your recombinant vector is fragmented and cloned using a suitable
vector. The bacteriophage vector M13 (see Chapter 6) is useful for this
purpose, since it will produce single-stranded versions of your fragments
which often give cleaner results. However, improvements in the technology
mean that good results can also be obtained with double-stranded plasmid
templates.
Note that it is essential to have overlapping fragments in this library, so
mechanical fragmentation is the best procedure (see Chapter 7). You then pick
recombinant clones at random from this mini-library and sequence each of
them ± an approach known as shotgun sequencing (see Figure 10.5). At the
start, you will have no idea where each bit of sequence comes from in the
original fragment ± nor even which strand of the original it is derived from.
However, once you have a number of such fragments sequenced, you can start
to use computer packages to compare each bit of sequence to all the others. The
computer will find any overlaps between the fragments, including comparing
the complementary strand in case you have two fragments that overlap but are
derived from different strands. Where there is an overlap, those fragments will
be joined together to form a contig. As the project progresses, each contig will
grow longer, and will then start to overlap other contigs. So the contigs
themselves are joined together until eventually you have one single contig
covering the whole of the original piece of DNA, and all the sequenced
fragments fit into that single contig (see Figure 10.6).

Shotgun cloning and sequencing

Of course, while initially each piece of sequence is new information, as you
proceed the sequencing becomes less and less productive. Towards the end,
nearly all the clones sequenced will be completely contained within one of the
existing contigs. Nevertheless, provided all parts of the fragment are equally
represented in the library, it is quicker to continue with a shotgun approach
rather than try to screen the library for the missing pieces. Sometimes, however,
parts of the original fragment are under-represented in the library; they may be
difficult to clone for some reason. If this is the case, you will have a gap in your
sequence that can be difficult to fill with a shotgun approach. If you have
reason to believe that the gap is quite small then you can use primer walking; as
described above, to bridge the gap. Alternatively you can use the sequences you
have determined to design PCR primers that will enable you to amplify a DNA
fragment that spans the gap, and can then be sequenced. Other approaches for
bridging gaps in longer sequences, such as genome sequences, are considered
below.
For any sequencing project, whatever the size of the DNA to be sequenced,
and whatever strategy is used, a diminishing returns effect is very marked. You
may get 90 per cent of the sequence accurately determined quite quickly; the
next 9 per cent may take as long again; and then the next 0.9 per cent a similar
length of time. It is usually necessary to set some limits to this: how complete
and how accurate do you need the sequence to be? Will 90 per cent do, or must
you have 99 per cent or 99.9 per cent? Without some sort of compromise you
can be drawn into a costly exercise trying to determine whether one difficult
base in a sequence of a million bases is G or C.

10.5 Genome Sequencing
10.5.1 Overview
In 1995, the first sequences of complete genomes (excluding viruses) were
published; these were of two bacteria, Haemophilus influenzae and Mycoplasma
genitalium. Although these are fairly small (1.83 Mb and 0.58 Mb, respectively)
in comparison with other bacteria, let alone mammalian or plant genomes,
they are much larger than the examples we have been considering so far. These
have been followed by sequences of the genomes of a number of other bacteria,
as well as some eukaryotes, including yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and of
course the human genome sequences. Some examples are shown in Box10.1.

The speed of progress in genome sequencing is such that it is no longer sensible
to produce a definitive list; it would be long out of date before this book is
published. However, you can see lists of sequenced organisms (and access a lot
of information about the sequences) at the Web sites listed. You will find
information not only about completed projects but also projects that are still
in progress. Some of the genome projects (including the Sanger Centre) have a
policy of releasing all sequence data as it becomes available, on a daily basis.
This is raw sequence with no annotation (i.e. nothing to tell you what it codes
for or any other information), but it can be searched for the occurrence of
specific sequences, which is very useful to a research worker.
Once the contigs have been assembled and a stage is reached when a
reasonably confident decision can be made as to where all the bits go, then it
can be labelled as a draft sequence. Note that at this stage there are likely to be
gaps in the sequence, although informed predictions can be made as to the
position and size of those gaps. There will also be some uncertainties and errors
in the sequence. The next stage is the finishing process, which involves filling in
the gaps and correcting the more obvious errors and uncertainties. A finished
sequence will contain no known gaps, and will be accurate to a defined level.
The final stage is annotation, when protein-coding sequences are identified and
predictions made as to the nature of the products. A wide variety of other
features are also identified at this stage. (Annotation and further analyses are
considered in Chapter 11.)
This description of a genome sequencing project makes it sound like a
production line, and indeed the analogy is not inappropriate. In a large project,
the various stages ± cloning, sequencing, assembly, finishing, annotation ± are
carried out by separate teams, and the product from one team (clones or
sequence data) is passed on to the next stage. However, you should not take
the analogy too literally ± information flows both ways, and one stage does not
have to be completed before the next stage starts, e.g. assembly takes place
concurrently with the generation of sequence data.
At the end of the process we have a finished (and annotated) sequence, and
we would say that we have determined the complete genome sequence of the
target organism We need to consider what we mean when we say this. For the
bacterial genomes that have been sequenced, this is literally true ± we know
(within the chosen limits of accuracy) which base is present at every single
position in the genome. However, no eukaryotic genome has been completely
sequenced to this level. For these eukaryotic genomes, the definition of `finished' is set lower, for example to mean more than 95 per cent of the euchromatic regions (which contain most of the genes) sequenced (to the set standard
of accuracy). with no gap more than 150 kb. (This definition will vary from one
project to another.) The published human genome sequences do not meet even
this definition. Overall, at the time when the data were prepared for publication, the coverage was about 85 per cent (or about 90 per cent of euchromatin),

172

DNA SEQUENCING

and both versions had a large number of gaps in them. The published sequences were therefore labelled as rough drafts. The coverage has increased
since the original publication of the human genome sequence data, and at the
time of writing about 70 per cent of the euchromatin is considered finished,
with the remainder being in draft form. (See the web sites listed in Box 10.1 for
an update on these figures.) Furthermore, these are not unique sequences of
single individuals, but are a composite of sequences from several sources ±
unlike the bacterial sequences which are derived from a single strain of that
species. These are probably not serious limitations. For example, many of the
gaps are due to the occurrence of repetitive DNA (which can be difficult to
sequence); this is assumed to be `junk' DNA. Most, if not all, of the significant
coding sequences will be present in the sequence that has been determined ±
and therefore for practical purposes we `know' the sequence of the human
genome.

10.5.2 Strategies
Various strategies, or combinations of strategies, can be used for determining
sequences of DNA as long as a complete genome (or a complete chromosome).
One is to extend the concept of shotgun sequencing as described above, that is
simply to make a library of small random fragments of the whole genome and
sequence them (Figure 10.7). This requires the isolation and sequencing of a

vast number of clones, which is made possible by the use of robotic methods for
all stages of the process ± picking the clones, extracting the DNA, setting up the
sequencing reactions. Furthermore, the contig assembly of such a large number
of individual random sequences requires a very substantial amount of computer power. This is not an impossible strategy; many bacterial genomes have
been sequenced in just this way, and this formed a major part of the strategy for
one of the human genome sequencing projects. However, it is not the only way
of doing it.
The main alternative is to split the problem up into defined units first. For a
eukaryotic organism, you might want to separate the chromosomes to start
with, and treat each chromosome as a separate project. Then (or instead), you
can make a library representing the whole genome or chromosome, using a
vector that can carry appropriate sizes of insert (e.g. a cosmid). You would
then determine the sequence of the insert in individual cosmids, and subsequently assemble the cosmid sequences into a complete genomic sequence.
Some of the sequencing projects have started with random cosmids, while
others have attempted to arrange the cosmids into an ordered library first
(i.e. one in which the relative position of all of the cosmids has been defined ±
see Chapter 7).
One advantage of this strategy is that very many laboratories are capable of
determining a sequence of the size of an individual cosmid insert, so it is
possible to distribute the cosmids to different laboratories for sequencing. On
the other hand, the total shotgun approach is highly centralized and only
possible in a very few centres. A further advantage of the `clone by clone'
approach is that useful information is generated at intermediate stages in the
project ± the sequence of an individual cosmid is a coherent piece of information ± while the shotgun approach consists of large numbers of essentially
meaningless sequences of small fragments until sufficiently large contigs have
been assembled. On the other hand, the shotgun method does start generating
sequence data almost from the beginning, without having to produce cosmid
libraries.

10.5.3 Repetitive elements and gaps
Two problems encountered in genome sequencing are worth considering:
repetitive elements and gaps. Most genomes contain repetitive elements: identical sequences which occur more than once (often many times) in the genome.
The amount of repetitive DNA varies substantially between organisms,
ranging from a few percent to at least 50 per cent in the human genome.
There are various classes of repeat sequences, including dispersed (or interspersed) repeats, mainly mobile elements such as insertion sequences and

174

DNA SEQUENCING

transposons, which occur at different sites distributed around the genome, and
tandem repeats of shorter sequences (even as short as 1±3 nucleotides) which
occur many times in succession at one locus. There may also be segmental
duplications, where a block of perhaps several hundred kilobases of DNA has
been copied to a different region of the genome. Any repetitive element is likely
to cause problems in contig assembly. Two fragments of sequence that end with
part of a repetitive element may be identified by the computer as overlapping,
when in fact they are derived from quite different parts of the genome. This is
more of a problem with the total shotgun approach than when sequencing
individual cosmids, because the separate cosmids are much less likely to carry
more than one copy of an insertion sequence. Tandem repeats cause a rather
different problem: the overlapping fragments are genuinely adjacent, but the
number of copies of the tandem repeat may be miscounted.
An additional factor has also to be borne in mind: many of these repetitive
elements are inherently hypervariable; mobile elements can transpose to different sites, and tandem repeats can vary in their copy number. Care has to be
taken that the starting material is homogeneous, and the possibility of alterations during the various cloning steps has to be considered.
In the discussion of smaller-scale sequencing projects, we considered the
problem of gaps remaining after contig assembly. This is even more important
for genome sequencing, and generally arises because of difficulties in cloning
certain fragments of DNA. Primer walking as described above is less likely to
be useful in this context because many of the gaps will be too big. PCR can be
used to amplify a fragment to bridge the gap, but only if the sequences either
side can be aligned and if the gap is relatively short. If there are a number of
gaps in the sequence, it is likely to be impossible to guess the order of the
sequenced fragments.
Both of these problems can be addressed, at least in part, by the use of
different types of clones, and in particular by the use of supervectors (especially
bacterial artificial chromosomes, BACs) described in Chapter 6, which are
capable of accommodating inserts of hundreds or even thousands of kilobases.
These large inserts can bridge substantial gaps in the assembled genome.
Hybridization can be used to identify a recombinant carrying sequences overlapping with either side of the gap. Gaps may arise from the lethal nature of
certain sequences in multi-copy plasmids. The stringently controlled low copy
number of vectors such as BACs tends to reduce this problem. If the gap arises
from a sequence that is too lethal even for a low copy number plasmid, then
lambda vectors can be used, although the insert size is then limited to about
23 kb. Alternatively, if other approaches have eliminated most of the gaps, the
remaining gaps can be bridged by using PCR amplification of the relevant
region of the genome, thus avoiding the need for any cloning step.
Once the genome sequence has been finished, to meet the criteria of accuracy
and completeness laid down in the project specifications, the final, important,

10.5 GENOME SEQUENCING

175

step is annotation ± identifying the coding regions, the predicted products,
and other features of the sequence. This is considered in the next chapter.
However, despite all the excitement that is generated by the publication of a
genome sequence, knowing the sequence is only a means to an end, not an end
in itself. The important factor is what you can do with that vast amount of
information.

11 Analysis of Sequence Data
11.1 Analysis and Annotation
In the previous chapter, we described the strategies and techniques for sequencing DNA. Whether you have sequenced an individual gene or a complete
genome, there will be an understandable sense of achievement when contig
assembly is complete, and you have finally finished the sequence. However, the
job is not yet complete. Without some understanding of the significance of the
various components of the sequence, that series of A, G, C and T letters is like
reading an unknown foreign language, and without spaces or punctuation.
You can see the letters but what does it all mean? A complete understanding of
the role of every part of the sequence is an ambitious goal, but there are some
basic analyses that need to be done routinely before you are ready to publish
the sequence, or to deposit it in a sequence databank.

11.1.1 Open reading frames
The analysis starts with the identification of regions of DNA that you can
predict to code for expression of proteins. To keep it simple at this stage, we
will start with a discussion of sequences that do not have introns (such as
bacterial sequences and cDNA) so we do not have to consider the identification
of exons and introns. That will come in the next section.
The key to identifying protein-coding sequences is to remember that mRNA
has the potential to be translated into protein in any of three reading frames;
which one is actually used will depend on where the ribosomes start. Since at
this stage we may not know in which direction the DNA is transcribed, there
are six possible reading frames altogether ± three for an mRNA in one direction
and three if the mRNA is produced in the other direction. How do we know
which of these reading frames is used?
Fortunately, we are provided with a clue. In those reading frames that are
not used for translation, there are usually frequent stop codons. The same
applies to any regions of the sequence that do not code for proteins. This is not
just a fortunate coincidence ± it prevents the ribosomes from accidentally

178

ANALYSIS OF SEQUENCE DATA

producing useless, or even potentially damaging, products. On the other hand,
any region of the sequence that does code for a protein must, obviously, be free
of stop codons (until the stop codon that signifies the end of the protein). Such
a sequence, without any stop codons, is known as an open reading frame
(ORF). So we can use a computer to search the sequence for stop codons,
and an ORF (without stop codons) can be predicted to code for a protein, in
that reading frame. It is then straightforward to translate the DNA sequence
into a protein sequence.
This of course depends on a judgment as to how long an open reading frame
must be before being labelled as an ORF. Unless we put a minimum size on it,
the concept is meaningless ± every reading frame between two stop codons is
`open' in the sense that it has no stop codons. On the other hand, by excluding
ORFs below an arbitrary size, we would risk excluding genuine ORFs that do
actually code for small polypeptides. For example, if we were to consider as
significant only those ORFs of more than 300 bases (coding for 100 amino
acids, which would make a polypeptide of about 10 kDa), then we would miss
any polypeptides that are less than 10 kDa. However, if we make the size limit
too small, we run the opposite risk, of predicting expression of a small protein
when no such protein exists.
There are three extra clues that we can use. The most important of these is
the presence of a start codon. We can refine the concept of an ORF to mean the
distance between a start codon and the first stop codon in the same reading
frame. This is not actually as straightforward as it sounds. Although we regard
ATG (using DNA rather than RNA nomenclature) as the `normal' start
codon, many organisms sometimes use other start codons as well, such as
GTG, TTG or CTG ± in some cases, especially in bacteria, these other start
codons can be quite frequent. In such cases, we can also look for the presence
of a ribosomal binding site adjacent to the start codon.
The second extra clue is codon usage. The genetic code has many examples
of different codons that are synonymous, i.e. they code for the same amino
acid. Generally, these synonymous codons are not all used to the same extent ±
there is a preferred codon usage, which in some cases can be very marked.
Some codons may be used so rarely that we could use their presence in our
queried ORF as an indication that it is not really translated into a polypeptide.
However, we do have to be careful about arguments like this, especially as there
is a danger of circularity. If our knowledge of the codon usage of the target
organism is based on the sequence of a limited number of genes, our predicted
codon usage may not be accurate. If we then exclude ORFs that do not
conform to this codon usage, we will reinforce our incorrect assignment of
codon usage.
The third extra clue that we can use is a comparison of ORFs with predicted
proteins from other organisms. (We do not have to rely on the identified ORFs
from other sequences; we can ask the computer to compare the product of our

179

11.1 ANALYSIS AND ANNOTATION

suspected ORF with all the possible products that would arise from translation
of other complete sequences in all six reading frames.) If the predicted polypeptide from our query sequence is similar to polypeptides that might be
made by other organisms, this suggests that it is a real coding sequence.
Similarly we could look for known protein motifs in this sequence. The
comparison of sequences, and searching for motifs, are further considered
later in this chapter.
These factors can be exemplified by the data shown in Figure 11.1. This is
actually a portion (about 7 kb) of one of the cosmids used in the sequencing of
the Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome. It is quite straightforward to locate all
the stop codons on all six reading frames (three in each direction). In this case,
the sequence (as a simple text file) has been read by a program known as
Artemis (freely available from the Sanger Centre) to provide this display; there
are many other programs available that will perform such an analysis. In the
figure, the top three bands show the position of stop codons in the three
reading frames that are read from left to right, while the bottom three bands
show the complementary strand (read from right to left, 5H to 3H ). You will see
that the distribution of stop codons is far from uniform. If we consider that
only the largest ones are likely to encode `real' proteins, and therefore confine
ourselves to regions of, say over 450 bases (coding for a sequence of 150 amino
acids), there are three or more such sequences in each of the six reading frames.
In some places, four of the six reading frames have no stop codons within such
a distance, and it is highly unlikely that all of these are actually used to produce
proteins. (In some organisms, especially bacteriophages, overlapping genes do
exist, but this normally happens to only a very limited extent in larger
genomes.) So we then take start codons into account, and this reduces the
number considerably, but still leaves more potential ORFs (including some
overlapping ones) than are actually thought to exist.
Databank entries contain a substantial amount of annotation, in addition to
the sequence itself. This annotation shows the location of significant features of

the sequence, and, in particular, the assignment of ORFs. Artemis is capable of
reading the full EMBL entry and displaying these features. In Figure 11.2, we
can see the output from Artemis when it is supplied with this extra information.
This shows which of the potential ORFs in this region were considered (by
those doing the annotation) to represent `real' coding sequences, as well as (in
some cases) the likely function of the product. It is possible, with a relatively
small sequence such as that displayed, to examine each potential ORF individually and in detail. On the other hand, the analysis of a whole genome
requires computational methods that are capable of automatically scanning
the whole genome and provisionally assigning ORFs on the basis of the
factors outlined above. The final annotation still requires manual checking of
each potential coding sequence, and its function. We will look further at the
annotation of sequences, and the structure of databank entries, later in this
chapter.
However it is done, we have to remember that the assignment of ORFs, and
the possible function of the corresponding proteins, is only a prediction, and is
subject to a degree of uncertainty in the absence of direct evidence as to the
existence and properties of the encoded protein. If you extend the argument to
analysis of complete genomes, the necessary assumptions about the likely
minimum size of a protein means that statistics on the number of predicted
proteins have to be treated with care as they may miss an unknown number of
small proteins.

11.1 ANALYSIS AND ANNOTATION

11.1.2 Exon/intron boundaries
In eukaryotes, introns are spliced out from the primary transcript as the exons
are joined into an mRNA molecule (Figure 11.3). This is not a consideration
when analysing cDNA sequences. The primary transcript, heteronuclear RNA
(hnRNA) is so short-lived that it is unlikely to be represented in a cDNA library
± you can rest comfortably in the assumption that virtually every cDNA clone
you pick is derived from processed mRNA. Thus, the search for ORFs in
eukaryotic cDNA sequences is similar to prokaryotes, with the very convenient
exceptions that each transcription unit is neatly delineated ± you know you will
normally (if not always) find one ORF in the message, and you know that they
are likely to be complete in each clone (if the clone itself is complete).
Genomic DNA sequences are, of course, a different matter. We can only
start thinking of predicting the ORF if we can predict the mRNA sequence.
Luckily, we can. Human intron/exon boundaries are surrounded by some
recurrent motifs (as indeed you would expect, as it stands to reason that the
splicing mechanism must be based on sequence recognition). The most obvious
and conserved of these is the GU±AG motif. Most introns begin with GU

(encoded by GT in the sense strand of the DNA) and finish with AG. Obviously, this is not the whole truth; both of these combinations of two bases will
theoretically occur with a frequency of 1:16, so a longer, more variable,
sequence is required to define a splice site. There are computer algorithms
that will screen any genomic DNA sequences for these and predict any intron/
exon boundaries within this sequence. These algorithms are specific for each
organism, and are based on knowledge of thousands of intron/exon boundaries
determined by comparison of cDNA and genomic sequences.
In this way, the computer in effect excises the predicted introns and thus
assembles a predicted cDNA sequence. This cannot, however, be done with a
certainty that will make it reliable without some corroborating evidence.
Fortunately, such evidence is often at hand. The most obvious thing to do is
to search GenBank for matching full-length cDNA sequences, from the same
species or from a different one. Additional evidence can be obtained from
screening databanks of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) (see Chapter 13).

11.1.3 Identification of the function of genes and their
products
The methods described above will lead to a provisional assignment of ORFs, or
coding sequences, in our cloned DNA fragment. The next question is the
nature and function of those proteins. If we are dealing with the sequence of
a specific clone, we would start with a strong hypothesis as to what the protein
actually does. The reliability of that hypothesis will depend on the cloning
strategy and other evidence, and it may need confirming by other means. If the
hypothesis is reliable enough, we can move straight on to using the DNA
sequence to provide information about the protein itself (see below).
However, if we are dealing with an unknown stretch of DNA (and especially
if we are analysing a whole genome sequence), we would be starting with no
preconceived idea as to what the sequence actually codes for. In this case, we
have to resort to comparing each predicted sequence against all the known
protein sequences held in the databanks. (The methods for doing this are
discussed later on; as we will see then, it is possible to carry out such comparisons with DNA sequences as well as with predicted protein sequences, but
proteins usually give better results.) There are a number of possible outcomes
to such a search. If we are lucky, our protein may have a high level of similarity
to a well-characterized protein from another source (or even better, to a
number of such well-characterized proteins). In this case, we are on reasonably
safe ground in attaching that label to our protein as well.
There is a snag. Many proteins in the databanks, especially those predicted
from gene sequences, have a functional label attached to them not because of

11.1 ANALYSIS AND ANNOTATION

183

an established function, but because of their similarity to another protein with
an established function. Unless we look carefully at the evidence for the
identity of these proteins, there is a risk of building up a chain of such
similarities, becoming less and less reliable. In other words, gene A in one
genome is identified as coding for enzyme X. Then gene B, in a second genome,
is similar to gene A in the first genome, so it is also labelled as coding for
enzyme X. In a third genome we find a gene that is similar to B, so this is also
labelled as coding for enzyme X, and so on. We may end up with a gene that is
only remotely similar to the originally identified gene A.
We may be less lucky. Our predicted gene product may not have a high
degree of similarity to any known protein, so we cannot be certain as to its
function. However, it may show some features which are characteristic of
certain classes of protein, which would enable us to provisionally label it as,
for example, `probable membrane protein', or `possible oxidoreductase'. Or, it
may show no discernible resemblance to any sequence in the database, in which
case it has to be labelled as `unknown function'. This applies to a substantial
proportion of the predicted proteins in a typical genome sequence. We may
actually find that although it does have similarity to other proteins (or predicted proteins) in the database, these proteins are already labelled as `unknown function'; you can see one example (identified as Rv1752) in Figure
11.2).
However good these predictions look, they are still only predictions, which
need direct experimental evidence to prove them. This includes not only
verification of the biochemical functions of the gene product, but also testing
of its role in the physiology of the whole organism ± including its potential
role in causing a specific disease. If your cloning strategy was devised as a
search for a gene with a specific function you will have a good idea where to
start. Later on in this chapter, we will discuss what inferences can be made
from the predicted protein structure, and elsewhere in this book we consider
what deductions can be made from studying the levels and localization of
the transcript (Chapter 13), linking genetic and physical maps (Chapter 14),
the production and analysis of its protein product (Chapter 15), and the
study of what happens if the organism overexpresses or lacks the gene
(Chapter 17).
In the course of these sequence comparisons, we may also come across
pseudogenes. These are DNA sequences which have significant sequence similarity to `real' genes, i.e. to DNA sequences that are known or believed to
code for proteins, but the pseudogenes contain changes in the sequence that
make it unlikely to be functional. The simplest type of change is one that puts
a stop codon (or several stop codons) within what should be the coding
sequence. Some pseudogenes may be transcribed into mRNA (transcribed
pseudogenes), but these mRNA molecules cannot be translated into functional
proteins.

184

ANALYSIS OF SEQUENCE DATA

11.1.4 Expression signals
An ORF is of no significance unless that region of the DNA is transcribed (and
transcribed in the right direction). So you might consider that our prediction of
protein coding sequences could be made more precise by incorporating the
detection of transcription start (and stop) sites. Unfortunately, it is not quite
that simple. For example, in most bacteria a high proportion of genes are
transcribed by RNA polymerase recognizing promoter sites which have two
relatively conserved consensus regions: the À35 region (i.e. a region centred at
35 bases before the start of transcription) and a À10 region. The consensus
sequences for these two regions are TTGACA and TATAAT respectively (see
Chapter 2); but these only represent a consensus. Very few promoters have
exactly that sequence at either position, and the distance separating them can
vary by a few bases as well. If we build in that degree of flexibility into our
search for promoters we will end up with a large number of sites, most of which
are not genuine promoters. The binding of RNA polymerase is affected to a
lesser extent by the sequence of a larger region, extending over perhaps 70
bases, as well as by other factors such as the supercoiling of that region of the
chromosome.
In addition, the specificity of bacterial RNA polymerase can be changed by
substitution of a different sigma factor, enabling it to recognize promoters with
a markedly different structure. In organisms that are less well characterized
than E. coli, the structure of these alternative promoters may be unknown,
making promoter prediction impossible.
In eukaryotes, as usual the situation is even more complicated. The binding
of RNA polymerase II is mediated by a number of canonical elements with
similarity of structure, including the TATA-box, GC-box, and CAAT-box.
However, the spacing of these elements is not always consistent. Moreover,
there is an element of species variation, so the parameters for searching for a
transcription start site in a fruit fly are different from those needed to make the
corresponding prediction in a human sequence. A number of websites are
available for the prediction of transcription start sites in model organisms.
These take advantages of neural networks that utilize information from known
promoters in the same organism.
Although searching for possible promoters is likely to be of little or no use in
predicting coding sequences, the identification of sites from which a gene may
be transcribed can be useful information. In other words, rather than searching
the whole genome for promoter sequences to define coding regions, we could
take specific ORFs and look more carefully at the sequence upstream to see if
we can identify a potential promoter, and hence a possible transcription start
site. This can then form part of the annotation that is attached to our sequence
when we deposit it in the databanks. However, in the light of the above

11.1 ANALYSIS AND ANNOTATION

185

comments, it is very important to distinguish those possible promoters that
have been identified merely by prediction (and hence may not be reliable) from
those that that have been established by direct experimental evidence (see
Chapter 13).
In addition to searching for possible promoters (i.e. sites at which RNA
polymerase will bind) we can look for sites at which regulatory proteins can
attach to the DNA to repress, or activate, transcription. Many of these proteins
have quite well conserved, and characterized, recognition sequences, often
known as `boxes'. For example, in most bacteria iron uptake is regulated by
proteins belonging to one of two families, related to either Fur (the Ferric
Uptake Regulator protein of E. coli) or DtxR (the diphtheria toxin repressor of
Corynebacterium diphtheriae). These proteins, in the presence of Fe2 , bind to
specific DNA sites and repress transcription of the adjacent genes. Identification of a site such as the so-called `Fur box', to which Fur binds, therefore
provides an indication that the associated gene will be repressed in the presence
of an adequate supply of iron, which in turn suggests that the function of that
gene may be connected with iron uptake. There are a number of other known
`boxes', to which different regulatory proteins will bind, in both prokaryotes
and eukaryotes; for example, the E-box (for enhancer) has been associated with
an expression pattern following a circadian (24 hour) rhythm. It is possible to
screen DNA sequences for each of these boxes, providing evidence not only
relating to the regulation of the relevant genes, but also a clue as to their
possible function; the methods for searching for such binding sites, and other
structural features of a protein, are considered later. As with putative promoter
sites, it is essential to distinguish between computer predictions and direct
evidence.

11.1.5 Other features of nucleic acid sequences
The analysis of our DNA sequence does not end with the identification of
protein binding sites. One of the simplest, and yet very informative, analyses is
the base composition of the DNA, i.e. the ratio between GC and AT bases.
Overall, this ratio is characteristic of a particular species, and tends to be
similar between different species within a genus, while varying more widely
between less related organisms (sometimes as low as 30 per cent GC or as
high as 70 per cent). Base composition can therefore be used as an aid to
establishing the taxonomic relationship between different species.
Within bacterial genomes, the base composition tends to be reasonably
uniform from one region to another, but there are notable exceptions. We
may for example find, in an organism with an overall base composition of 65
per cent, a group of genes with a much lower GC content ± say 45 per cent.

186

ANALYSIS OF SEQUENCE DATA

Usually there is quite a sudden change in base composition at each end of this
region, which is known as an island. Many of the examples that have been
studied concern groups of genes that are connected with bacterial pathogenicity, and are hence referred to as pathogenicity islands, but the phenomenon is
not restricted to virulence determinants. What is the significance of these
islands?
Processes such as DNA replication and transcription, and particularly the
regulation of these processes, are to some extent sensitive to the base composition of the DNA. Therefore over an extended evolutionary period, the
enzymes involved in these processes, and the composition of the DNA, have
evolved together to produce a well-balanced system. Furthermore, the codon
usage of the genes is also related to the base composition ± so as the
codon usage and the specificity of the available tRNAs co-evolves, this will
also be reflected in the base composition of the DNA. The inference from this is
that these islands, with a different base composition, are relatively recent
arrivals. They represent DNA that has been acquired by the bacterium by
horizontal gene transfer from a different species. This inference has been
substantiated in some cases by direct evidence. For example, the genome of
Vibrio cholerae contains an island in which the genes for the cholera toxin are
found. It has been established that this island is in fact phage DNA that has
been integrated into the bacterial chromosome. Many other islands have been
shown to be integrated bacteriophages, either by direct evidence or by comparison of the sequence with that of known bacteriophages.
Mammalian DNA also contains `islands' with a different base composition
from that of the remainder of the genome, but these have a different significance. The dinucleotide CG (usually written as CpG to emphasize that we are
referring to consecutive bases on one strand) occurs much less commonly than
would be expected from a random distribution of bases. Yet in some regions,
the frequency of this doublet is very much higher, forming regions (CpG-rich
islands) up to 2 kb in length, with a much higher GC content than that of the
whole genome. There are many thousands of such regions in the genome. The
frequent association of CpG islands with promoter regions means that the
identification of such an island can be taken as suggesting a transcriptional
initiation region.
Amongst the many other features of DNA that are amenable to computer
analysis, we can single out the occurrence of inverted repeat sequences. It is
important to be clear about the meaning of an `inverted repeat'; since DNA
strands have a direction to them, and the two strands are in opposite directions,
an inverted repeat of say CAT is not TAC but ATG (see Figure 11.4). A pair of
inverted repeats, in close succession, can anneal together, so that a single strand
containing such a sequence will give rise to a hairpin structure, or if they are
separated by a few bases, a stem-loop structure (Figure 11.5). A well-known
example of such a structure is the tRNA molecule. Ribosomal RNA also exists

in a highly folded conformation, and mRNA transcripts will also form folded
structures. Although such structures are most common in single-stranded
nucleic acids (mainly RNA), they can also give rise to localized destabilization
of double-stranded DNA, most notably when the double helix is unwound
during replication. One of the significant aspects of such structures is the role
that they play in transcriptional termination; the formation of a stable stemloop structure in the mRNA favours the dissociation of the nascent mRNA
strand from the template DNA, allowing the two DNA strands to reanneal.
This causes the RNA polymerase to pause, and ultimately stop transcription.

188

ANALYSIS OF SEQUENCE DATA

Regulatory proteins often bind to inverted repeats. Many such proteins are
dimeric, so one subunit can bind to one copy of the inverted repeat, and the
other subunit to the second copy. The requirement for two binding sites gives a
higher degree of specificity to the interaction, as well as establishing a strong
interaction.
Repeated sequences are also a frequent cause of variation (see Chapter 12).
Inverted repeats are typically found at the ends of mobile genetic elements such
as transposons and insertion sequences. In addition, recombination between
inverted repeat sequences will lead to inversion of the region between them. In
contrast, recombination between two direct repeats will cause deletion of the
region between them. These sources of variation are not only an interesting
natural phenomenon; they can be a nuisance in gene cloning as the occurrence
of repeated sequences within your insert can cause instability of the construct.
Tandem direct repeats (that is, direct repeats with no intervening region) also
cause variation in another way ± by replication slippage. When the replication
apparatus encounters a tandem direct repeat, it may (very occasionally) jump
forwards or backwards, causing a loss or gain of additional copies of the
repeated sequence. One example of this is found in Huntington's disease,
where a CAG repeat in a gene called huntingtin has a tendency to slip and
extend itself. Above a certain length, the encoded poly-glutamate stretch in the
resulting protein will cause the disease.
Because the number of copies of a direct repeat at a specific site may
therefore vary from one individual to another, it forms the basis of one method
of molecular typing (see Chapters 12 and 16).

11.1.6 Protein structure
Having identified an ORF, and used the computer to translate it into a protein
sequence, we can then investigate a number of aspects of the structure of that
(maybe hypothetical) protein. This is obviously particularly important where
we do not already have clues to the function of our gene through its similarity
with others that have already been characterized. A full consideration of all the
possibilities is beyond the scope of this book, but it is worth a brief and selective
overview, especially as an examination of protein structure can provide some
leads as to its possible function.
For example, if we look at the amino acid composition of the protein, and
especially at the occurrence and distribution of hydrophobic and hydrophilic
amino acids, we should be able, just on this evidence, to detect if it is likely to
be a membrane protein. Proteins that are embedded in a membrane will
normally have substantial stretches of hydrophobic amino acids. Soluble proteins are more likely to be predominantly hydrophilic, although they can

189

11.1 ANALYSIS AND ANNOTATION

contain hydrophobic regions if the protein folds into a pocket that shields those
hydrophobic regions from the aqueous environment. If we look more closely at
the predicted structure (especially in combination with testing for specific
motifs ± see below) we may be able to guess whether it is involved in transport
across the membrane, or energy generation, or acts as a receptor for signal
transduction, or any of the other functions commonly associated with membrane proteins. As an example, Figure 11.6 show a hydrophobicity plot for the
human rhodopsin protein. This shows seven regions of marked hydrophobicity, with intervening regions that are more hydrophilic. The hydrophobic
regions are embedded in, and span, the membrane, so that at one end of a
transmembrane region the protein is exposed to the cytoplasmic environment,
while at the other end the protein protrudes into the external environment. This
is a commonly occurring theme in membrane proteins, especially in those
proteins that function as transporters (that is they ferry material across the
membrane) or as signal transducers (i.e. they respond to changes in the external
environment and transmit a signal across the membrane to the interior of the
cell).
Proteins, of course, do not exist merely as sequences of amino acids, but in
their native form adopt higher orders of conformation. Ideally we would like to
be able to predict, from the primary sequence of amino acids, which parts will
adopt secondary structures such as alpha-helices, and how those elements of
secondary structure will fold into the tertiary and higher orders of structure that
are characteristic of the native protein. However, the number of possibilities is
extremely large, and furthermore the final folding of the protein can be influenced by the folding of the polypeptide chain as it is made. The final structure is
not necessarily the most thermodynamically stable one. It is therefore rarely

ANALYSIS OF SEQUENCE DATA

possible to predict with any degree of certainty the final folding of a hitherto
unknown protein (although it may be possible to identify likely regions of
specific secondary structures such as alpha helices). For this, in spite of the
huge increase in computer capacity, we are still left with the need to produce
crystals of the pure protein for X-ray crystallography.
However, as more and more proteins are characterized at this level, it
becomes increasingly likely that the unknown protein we have predicted is a
member of a family of proteins, some of which have been characterized
structurally. By aligning the sequences, we can therefore make much more
reliable predictions as to the likely conformation of our unknown protein.

11.1.7 Protein motifs and domains
Although our protein may not show much overall similarity to any other
characterized protein, we may find, if we look more closely, that it contains
short sequences of amino acids that are very similar to parts of a number of
other proteins. These conserved regions are known as motifs. The recognition
of motifs provides yet another clue as to the function of our protein, or other
aspects of its structure.
Some motifs occur because a wide range of enzymes, with otherwise disparate properties, may use the same substrate. For example, there is a wide range
of enzymes that uses ATP as a substrate. In many cases, the region of the
enzyme that binds the ATP has a similar structure ± although the remainder of
the sequence may show no similarity. If we can recognize the presence of a
putative ATP-binding site in our protein, then we can infer that it is probably
an enzyme that uses ATP as a substrate.
The overall reaction catalysed by some enzymes is actually a series of
separate reactions, with different parts of the enzyme responsible for different
steps. For example, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (catalysing the first step in fatty
acid synthesis) has one component with a covalently attached biotin, a second
component with (noncovalent) binding sites for ATP and CO2 which carboxylates the biotin, and a third component, with an acetyl-CoA binding site,
which transfers the carboxyl moiety from the biotin to the acetyl-CoA. In E.
coli these components are made as separate polypeptides which associate with
one another to form the complete holoenzyme. On the other hand, in mammalian cells the enzyme is made as a single polypeptide with different parts of the
structure responsible for the different activities. We refer to these elements as
domains. It is not uncommon to find enzymes that consist of several subunits in
one organism but as a single polypeptide with several domains in another
source ± probably due to a fusion of genes that originally evolved separately
(see Chapter 12). Domains often form more or less structurally-independent
regions of a protein ± in other words each domain folds up into its own

11.1 ANALYSIS AND ANNOTATION

secondary structure with little or no structural interaction with the other
domains, other than a flexible loop connecting them. You can visualize such a
structure, roughly, as a set of balls connected by bits of string.
As well as substrate-binding sites, there are a range of other motifs that
indicate sites for structural modification such as lipid or sugar attachment, for
secretion or for targeting to specific cellular compartments, or in the case of
regulatory proteins, for DNA binding. There are libraries of known motifs
available, so it is a simple matter to screen a protein sequence for any of
these motifs. One of the longest-established libraries of patterns is PROSITE.
Figure 11.7 shows the output from a web-based search for motifs present in
protein Rv0194 (a protein from M. tuberculosis which is identified as a
probable transporter protein; SwissProt accession number O53645), and
demonstrates the presence of two ATP-binding motifs, and a signature

sequence for the family of proteins known as ABC (ATP-binding cassette)
transporters.
A further useful tool is the Pfam database of protein domain families,
available at several sites, including the Sanger Centre (http://www.sanger.
ac.uk). Rather than identifying specific motifs, this uses a set of multiple
sequence alignments for each family. (Technically, these alignments are encoded using a statistical treatment known as Hidden Markov Models; HMMs
have a variety of applications in bioinformatics.) Figure 11.8 shows the output
from an analysis of the same protein as used in Figure 11.7. The first table
shows the matches to the Pfam-A database, which is a high-quality, curated
database (i.e. the quality is maintained manually). The second table shows
matches to Pfam-B families, which are computer-generated, of lower quality
and do not contain annotation. Rather than merely identifying short motifs,
this analysis has identified domains that are characteristic of this family of
proteins. The motifs identified by Prosite will be found within the domains
labelled ABC_tran.

11.2 Databanks
Once we have determined a DNA sequence, it should be made publicly and
freely accessible by submitting it to a databank (EMBL, GenBank, or the

11.2

DATABANKS

193

Japanese databank DDBJ). This is done electronically via the internet, and the
databanks have Web-based procedures that make this submission a simple
automatic process (see Appendix A for the Web addresses). In practise, the
databanks can be considered as one and the same, as they share their information on a daily basis, and wherever you live you can just choose the one
whose interface you prefer. It is only necessary to submit your sequence to (or
to search in) one of them. Each sequence in the databank is allocated a unique
accession number, which should be quoted in publications referring to that
sequence, and the use of the accession number makes it easy to retrieve that
sequence from the databank. An example of an EMBL databank entry for an
individual sequence (the gene for the transcarboxylase subunit of acetylCoA
carboxylase, accA, from E. coli) is shown in Figure 11.9. Genome sequence
data is annotated in a similar way, but is often, for convenience, included in the
databanks in sections which may correspond to actual clones (cosmids for
example). These clones can usually be ordered directly from national and
international genome resource centres. The fragments of the genome sequence
may also be `virtual clones' (i.e. arbitrarily divided sections of the genome).
Whole chromosomes or whole genomes may also be included as a single
sequence, and are useful for some forms of analysis ± but downloading a
whole chromosome sequence and analysing it may stretch the capability of
your computer or your software.
Entries in GenBank look slightly different, but the information contained is
the same, and you should have little difficulty in switching from one to the
other. Both are computer-readable, provided that the software has been set up
to recognize the format.
The notes that we have added to the annotation should mainly be selfexplanatory, but some aspects need additional comment. The identifier (ID) is
a short label that may give some clues as to the nature of the entry. In this case it
indicates that the sequence is from E. coli, and that it contains (part of) the
adjacent polC (dnaE) gene as well as accA. (To keep the figure simple, information about polC has been removed from the annotation.) The accession
number (AC) is important as it is the most convenient way of retrieving a specific
sequence from the databank, and the one that is referred to in publications; the
accession number is the same in the different databanks (whereas the ID differs).
It refers to a particular sequence submission, rather than to a specific gene or
locus. There may therefore be several entries, with different accession numbers,
relating to the same sequence. Some may be partial, incomplete or unassembled
sequences, or even inaccurate ones, that have in effect been superseded by later
versions. If you want to look for different versions of a specific gene you may
therefore need to search the databank by gene name, or alternatively use a
known sequence and search for similarities (e.g. using BLAST, see below).
In addition to the sequence itself, there is scope for a considerable amount of
annotation that makes the sequence information much more useful. The more

annotation you can reliably include, the more useful your submitted sequence
is. Obviously you will need to include information about the source of the
sequenced DNA. In addition, the identification and extent of any open reading
frame is a basic requirement (together with the computer prediction of the
protein sequence), intron/exon boundaries (if applicable) and any further information on expression signals, motifs, structural elements, as identified above

will enhance the value of the submission, as well as identification of the
presumed or actual function of the gene. This information goes into the
features table (lines starting with FT), and it is this information that is read
by programs such as Artemis (see above).
In addition to DNA sequences, there are databanks of protein sequences
available via the same sources. The principal one is known as SWISS-PROT,
and you will see in the figure that a reference is provided that identifies the
corresponding entry in the SwissProt database. There are two types of protein
sequence information. Some protein sequences are derived from direct protein
sequencing, but the majority are derived by computer translation of DNA
sequences. Some care is needed when using computer-generated protein sequences, especially as there may be no direct evidence that this protein actually
exists. Furthermore, it may be based on misidentified intron/exon boundaries,
the identification of the start site may be incorrect, or a variety of other factors
(including post-translational modification or cleavage) may result in the protein within the cell being substantially different from the primary translation
product. In particular, a base missing or incorrectly inserted will result in a shift
of the reading frame, and the protein sequence beyond that point will bear no
relationship to the real product.

11.3 Sequence Comparisons
11.3.1 DNA sequences
There is a vast, and rapidly growing, amount of sequence data available in the
databanks. How can we find out if our sequence is the same as (or very similar
to) some other sequence that has already been determined?
We can start by considering the simplest approach. Suppose we have 1 kb of
sequence data (and we will for the moment ignore the possible complication of
introns). We can put our sequence (the query sequence) alongside each of the
entries in the databanks, and count the number of bases that match. (Fortunately we do not have to do this one at a time; the computer software will
automatically pull out each sequence entered in the databank and compare
them for us in a remarkably short period of time.) However, there will be a lot of
fragments of different lengths, and they will not necessarily start at the same
place. So we (or rather the computer) must slide our sequence along each of the
sequences it is being compared with and see where the best match comes.
Clearly, we do not want to know how well it matches with all the sequences in
the databanks, but we can instruct the computer to list, say, the best 50 matches.
There is, however, another problem. Our sequence may have one or more
gaps in it, compared with the potential match in the databank. This can happen

196

ANALYSIS OF SEQUENCE DATA

in several ways: we may be trying to compare cDNA and genomic sequences,
there may be an error in our sequence, or one or more bases may have been
deleted in the DNA of the organism from which we have cloned this fragment.
We also have to recognize that the sequence in the databank may be wrong.
This is particularly likely in the case of expressed sequence tags (ESTs, see
Chapter 13), which are not produced with a high requirement for accuracy.
For example our sequence may read, at one point, GGACT, while at the
corresponding point in the databank sequence, which otherwise matches perfectly, the sequence is GGGACT. This is a very small difference, but the
consequence would be that part of our sequence would line up perfectly,
while the rest would not match at all (or more strictly it would match just as
well as any two random bits of DNA). In order to accommodate this problem,
we can allow the computer to introduce gaps into one or both sequences.
We cannot allow the computer indefinite licence to introduce as many gaps
as it likes, otherwise it would produce perfect matches between any two
sequences, just by repeatedly sliding them apart until it found the next base
that matched. The algorithm therefore incorporates a gap penalty; every time a
gap is introduced, into either sequence, there is a reduction in the score. The
gap penalty can be set at different levels, including different penalties for
different lengths of gaps, although the software usually has a default value so
we do not have to think about it.
There are several methods available for comparing DNA sequences, and
some of them employ algorithms that essentially work as described above
(although the description is highly simplified!). However, this requires a lot of
computer power for longer sequences, if carried out literally as described. As the
computer slides the two sequences along base by base, at each position it has to
calculate a score with all possible combinations of gaps ± even for a sequence of
say 1kb, there is a very large number of possible combinations.
Other programs therefore employ different algorithms that are designed to
speed up the process. One approach is basically to split our sequence (the query
sequence) into small fragments (words), using these words to decide how the
two sequences will align best and then computing a score for the optimal
alignment, including allowing for gaps. This is more or less the basis for one
of the common search programs known as FASTA. We will look at an example
of a FASTA search, for protein databases, later on.
One of the most widely used programs is known as BLAST (Basic Local
Alignment Search Tool). At a highly simplified level, this works by finding very
short matches (segment pairs) and then extending that match outwards until the
score falls below a set value. Each matched pair of sequences above a certain
length is then stored and reported (as High-scoring Segment Pairs, or HSPs),
starting with those with the highest score. Figure 11.10 shows the result of a
database search using BLAST, using the E. coli accA gene as the query sequence.

phylogenetic relationships, and as we will see later on the order may change,
and different matches may be found, if the search is done using a different
program (e.g. FASTA instead of BLAST) or using different values for parameters such as the gap penalty.
The BLAST search will also return the pairwise alignment of the query
sequence with each of the matches; one example is shown in Figure 11.10(b),
although this is not necessarily the optimal alignment (see the section on
CLUSTAL below). Note that in this case the computer has used the reverse
complement of the query sequence, as indicated by the label `Strand  Minus/
Plus'. You will see that although this is the highest scoring match shown
in Figure 11.10(a), there are substantial differences between the two sequences
(71 per cent identity). We will look later on at the match between these two
sequences at the protein level.

DNA sequence comparisons are inherently noisy. If you just take two random
DNA sequences and put them side by side, there is a 25 per cent chance of a
match at any specific position. For example suppose sequence X has a T at
position 47; sequence Y, as a random sequence, will have an equal chance of
having A, C, G or T at position 47 (assuming also an equal proportion of all
four bases), so the chance of it matching is 1 in 4. Sometimes you have to use
DNA sequence comparisons, for example if you are working with a non-coding
sequence, but generally for searching databanks with an unknown sequence
you will get much cleaner results with a protein sequence. (Note that all the
predicted coding sequences in the DNA databanks are translated and incorporated in a protein sequence bank such as SwissProt.) A further advantage of
searching at the protein level is that related proteins are generally more conserved than are the genes encoding for them.
The initial basis for protein sequence comparisons is just the same as described above for nucleotide sequence comparisons, and the algorithms used
are fundamentally the same. The major difference arises from the fact that you
have 20 amino acids instead of four bases. This doesn't have to change
anything ± you can treat the 20 amino acids as all different from one another,
and require a perfect match (identity) at any position. However, the computer
usually offers you a more sophisticated scoring system, in which some pairs of
amino acids are regarded as more different than others. This scoring system is
based on a matrix of all the possible amino acid pairings, ranging from some
pairs which score almost the same as a perfect match through to other pairs
which are regarded as completely different. All of the scores in the matrix are
used to calculate the overall score for the match, although the alignment
presented will only mark matches above a selected cut-off score.

200

ANALYSIS OF SEQUENCE DATA

There are several such matrices to choose from, although here again the
package you use will probably have a default in case you do not want to make a
choice; but even if you accept the default, you should have some understanding
of the basis of the matrix that is used. It is a common misconception that the
alignment is calculated solely on the basis of the similarity between the amino
acids; for example, a biochemist might group valine, leucine and isoleucine
together as they have large nonpolar (hydrophobic) side chains, phenylalanine,
tyrosine and tryptophan (aromatic), glutamate with aspartate (acidic, negatively charged), lysine and arginine (basic, positively charged), and so on.
A change from one amino acid to another within the same group (say lysine
to arginine) would be expected to have less effect on the structure and function
of the protein than a change between groups (say lysine to phenylalanine), and
so you would expect this similarity to be reflected in the scoring system.
That is indeed partly true; but in fact commonly used matrices such as the
Dayhoff Point Accepted Mutation (PAM) matrices are derived empirically
from comparisons of related proteins from different sources, and the score is
derived from the frequency with which specific changes in amino acid sequence
occur. This partly reflects the similarity between the amino acids, but is also
influenced by the nature of the genetic code. Where a pair of amino acids can
be interchanged by only a single base change in the DNA, this will occur more
frequently than a change that requires two or three base changes. There are a
series of PAM matrices with different values; one example (the PAM250
matrix) is shown in Figure 11.11. Values of zero indicate neutral changes,

while increasing positive or negative values indicate increasingly acceptable or
unacceptable mutations, respectively. Note that in some cases, a mismatch can
give a positive score ± and in particular a mismatch between tyrosine (Y) and
phenylalanine (F) actually gives a higher score than a perfect match of most
other amino acids. If you are not familiar with the one-letter amino acid

ANALYSIS OF SEQUENCE DATA

The PAM matrices were derived from studies of proteins that are very
similar. However, database searches are commonly used for the identification
of more distantly related sequences, and under these conditions the PAM
matrices are not necessarily ideal. An alternative family of matrices known as
BLOSUM (`blossom') ± BLOcks SUbstitution Matrix ± can be used; these are
derived in a somewhat different way. The same considerations apply; it is just
the values that are different. Some of the subsequent comparisons use the
BLOSUM62 matrix.
Figure 11.12 shows the output from a BLAST search of the SwissProt
database, using, as the query sequence, the translated product of the E. coli
accA gene that we employed for the nucleic acid search above. The general
structure of the table is the same (although we have only shown the ID and not
the accession numbers, to simplify it). As before, we have added our own
reference numbers in the first column; numbers up to 31 indicate that the
protein is derived from the corresponding sequence in Figure 11.10. Higher
numbers show sequences that did not figure in the nucleic acid comparison.
(We should discount the asterisked ones, where the difference is solely due to
an update of the database.) Apart from these, the top six sequences are in the
same order as before; thereafter the order is far from identical, and as we go
further down the table we find a number of sequences where a match was found
at the protein level that did not register in the DNA search. In some cases, the
reason is clear: the organisms differ substantially in the base composition of
their DNA. This accounts, for example, for the presence of mycobacterial and
Streptomyces sequences in this figure but not in the DNA comparison. The
protein sequences are quite well conserved, but the difference in the base
composition of the DNA (about 65 per cent GC, compared to 50 per cent
for E. coli) means that the DNA sequences are less similar.
You should not be too impressed by the fact that most of these matches are
labelled as acetyl/propionyl-CoA carboxylase: many of them are from genome
sequence data, and the only reason they have this label is precisely because of
their similarity to proteins such as the E. coli AccA. In this example, it is
probably correct, but the potential for a circular argument has to be remembered at all times.
As before, the program will also return a pairwise alignment of the sequences. If you compare the protein alignment shown in part (b) with the
alignment of the corresponding DNA sequences in Figure 11.10, you will see
that the protein comparison produces a much clearer similarity. For optimal
alignment, and for alignment of multiple sequences, CLUSTAL (see below)
should be used.
Note that all the cautionary comments discussed in relation to nucleic acid
searches also apply to protein sequence comparisons: the list of matches is not
definitive, the order shown is not necessarily a true reflection of the order of
similarity, and you may get a different set of matches if you use a different

11.10 (b). See also Table CLUSTAL for alignment of these proteins with others selected from part (a) of this table.

The line between the two sequences shows identical amino acids, and (marked with +) those positions
scored as positive similarities according to the matrix used (in this case BLOSUM62).

using the same query sequence, but this time using FASTA instead of
BLASTP. The differences are not dramatic; this is a reasonably well-conserved
protein and so there are a large number of good matches, which will show up
however you do the analysis. As you move further down the table, however, the
extent of the differences increases ± so much so that there are a number of
sequences in this list that cannot be considered as a significant match, although
they showed a respectable score in the BLAST comparison. Conversely, some
proteins that appear in the BLASTP search were not detected as a match by
FASTA.

ANALYSIS OF SEQUENCE DATA

FASTA and BLAST, although they work in different ways, have one thing
in common: they are essentially shortcuts to enable database searches to be
carried out rapidly without demanding too much computer power. The price to
be paid is the possibility of missing something significant. A possibly more
sensitive method is provided by the Smith±Waterman algorithm, which is used
by a program known as MPsrch.
The comparison between the methods highlights an important message.
Many matches feature in all searches, but not in the same order of score. On
the other hand, some matches were found by one method and not by another.
With a less well-conserved protein, these differences would be greater. Furthermore, these searches were carried out using the default values for parameters
like gap penalties; carrying out the same search with different values of these
parameters might produce further differences in the list of matches. The takehome message is that the list of matches resulting from any program is not a
definitive list of all matching sequences, nor the last word in how well those
sequences match.
As we have mentioned above, only a small minority of the proteins in the
databases have been sequenced as such. Most of them have been deduced from
the corresponding cDNA and genomic DNA sequences, with varying degrees
of confidence. These predictions are not necessarily either accurate or complete
± for example a product may be translated from a different reading frame, or
transcription (from a genomic sequence) may occur in the opposite direction.
Conversely, and even more likely, if your own DNA sequence that you wish to
compare is incomplete, you will not be able to accurately predict intron/exon
boundaries (if applicable) or the location and direction of the ORF. However,
it is possible to instruct the computer to compare the predicted products of all
potential reading frames of your DNA, even in both directions, against the
protein sequences deposited in the database ± or even all six reading frames of
your query sequence against all six reading frames of the DNA sequences in the
databanks.
GenBank also has sections that are based on sequence variation, rather than
the canonical sequence for each given species. One of these, the Taxonomy
Database, lists sequences by species, organized according to taxonomic boundaries. Another section, the SNP database, is dedicated to cataloguing single
nucleotide polymorphisms between individuals of one species. More specifically, the OMIM database (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man) catalogues
information, both genetic and phenotypical, about known genetic diseases.

11.3.3 Sequence alignments: CLUSTAL
As indicated in the above discussion, search methods such as FASTA and
BLAST do not necessarily display the optimal alignment between your query

11.3

SEQUENCE COMPARISONS

207

sequence and the target. Furthermore, they only show pairwise alignments,
whereas you are likely to want to see how your sequence lines up with
a collection of other proteins. (Similar arguments apply to nucleic acid comparisons, but we will just look at protein alignments.) In order to produce
optimized multiple alignments, the most commonly used program is CLUSTAL. (Many suites of programs incorporate a version of CLUSTAL for
sequence alignments, although not necessarily identifying it as such.)
CLUSTAL starts by comparing all the sequences submitted, to produce a
matrix of pairwise alignment scores. This can be displayed as a dendrogram, a
`family tree' of sequences. This information is then used to organize the
alignment process, following the branching order of the dendrogram, until a
multiple alignment of all the proteins is produced. The comments above about
gap penalties and amino acid substitution matrices also apply to CLUSTAL
alignments. In addition to the multiple alignment, the program will also
generate a consensus sequence. An example of the output from CLUSTAL,
using a selection of the protein matches from Figure 11.12, is shown in Figure
11.14. It can be seen that a substantial number of amino acids (indicated by an
asterisk) are conserved in all the sequences shown, whether from bacterial,
plant or mammalian sources.
The alignment produced should not be regarded as absolute ± indeed a visual
inspection may show places where the alignment could obviously be improved,
for example by introducing an extra gap into one of the sequences. Remember
that there is no such thing as a perfect alignment, and the alignment produced
does not necessarily have any absolute meaning; this is mainly a tool to display
features of the sequence.
Alignments of sequences can be used, cautiously, as aids towards the establishment or confirmation of evolutionary relationships. Some of the conserved
amino acids that are identified by the alignment may have real significance,
such as indicating a substrate-binding motif for example, and it is then likely
that the aligned amino acids do actually represent an evolutionary relationship.
However, in many cases, to be able to draw such a conclusion, you would need
to look at the position of this amino acid in the three-dimensional structure of
the proteins you are comparing.

12 Analysis
of Genetic
Variation
12.1 Nature of Genetic Variation
The basic structure and organization of genes, in eukaryotes and prokaryotes,
was considered in Chapter 2. It is a central dogma of molecular biology that the
inherited characteristics of an organism are a reflection of the structure and
organization of its genes. However, it is important to realize that this includes
an extremely complex set of interactions between different genes, and their
products, as well as environmental factors. The gene(s) directly responsible for
the observed characteristic may be absolutely identical but the effects may be
different because of variation in other genes that affect their expression, or
because of alteration in other cellular components that affect the activity of the
proteins encoded by those genes. Environmental influences will therefore have
a major role in determining the observed characteristics of the organism.
Excessive reductionism ± ascribing every change to one single gene ± is an
ever-present pitfall in the analysis of variation, as many traits are much more
complex than that.
We can use the study of genetic variation to examine differences between
members of the same species, ranging from the study of bacterial characteristics
(such as antibiotic resistance) to investigation of human genetic diseases, or to
differentiate between individuals (for example in forensic analysis). Alternatively, we can compare the genetic composition of members of different species
± even over wide taxonomic ranges ± which can throw invaluable light on the
processes of evolution as well as helping to define the taxonomic relationship
between species. Many of the concepts involved are similar, but of course the
differences are (usually) much greater when we are comparing widely different
species.

210

ANALYSIS OF GENETIC VARIATION

12.1.1 Single nucleotide polymorphisms
The simplest form of genetic variation consists of a change in the sequence of
bases at a single point. Such differences are called single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). It is worth reflecting briefly on the consequences of such a simple
change. The first possibility is that the polymorphism is not even within a gene;
indeed in eukaryotes that is the most common occurrence (this is both because
most eukaryotic DNA is not a part of any gene, and because a non-coding
sequence is where a polymorphism is least likely to have a negative effect).
Second, if the change is within a gene, the chances are (again in eukaryotes)
that it is in an intron and (unless it affects a splice site) does not affect the
resulting gene products. Even if it is within an exon, there may be no change at
all in the sequence of the protein encoded by that gene. A single base change
may alter for example a leucine codon such as UUA into CUA, which also
codes for leucine (Figure 12.1). This is referred to as a synonymous substitution.
This would be expected to have little or no effect on the organism (and hence is
also referred to as a silent mutation) ± although the change in codon usage
could have some effect on the translation of the mRNA. Other changes may
also be silent, although not synonymous. A change from UUA to GUA would
replace the leucine with valine at that position in the protein, which may have
little consequence for protein structure and function (depending on how critical
that specific position is), since leucine and valine are similar amino acids. Other
changes, such as UUA to UCA (serine), are more likely to have an effect,
although such a change (and even more radical changes) can be tolerated at
some positions. These non-synonymous (or missense) substitutions therefore
may or may not give rise to changes in the characteristics of the cell.
Most commonly these changes will either have no significant effect or will
simply impair or destroy the function of the product of the gene. Very rarely,
they will lead to a protein that can function in a slightly altered way ± for
example, an enzyme that may be able to use a different substrate. An

NATURE OF GENETIC VARIATION

accumulation of such mutations may eventually give rise to an enzyme which
carries out quite a different reaction. This is of course the basis of the gradual
process of evolution. It is also important to keep in mind the differences that
diploidy makes in species such as our own. Clearly, having two copies of each
gene allows more leeway for evolutionary drift in one allele, as long as the other
one functions normally. This is why carriers of a recessive disease gene generally are not affected by it. When analysing genetic variation in diploid organisms, it is obviously paramount to keep in mind that the organism has two
copies of each gene (with exceptions such as the X chromosome genes in
mammals), and that the individual can be either homozygous or heterozygous
for any given genetic variation. There are potential pitfalls here; for example,
you may screen an individual for a particular SNP, find only the wild-type
allele and conclude that it is a homozygote. However, if that individual had a
large deletion in one allele deleting a large part of or the whole gene, then you
would, with many methods, only see one allele, and might erroneously conclude that the individual is homozygous.
However, it is much easier to obtain a mutation that results in the loss of
function than one which changes the characteristics of the product, so although
we can study the products of changes that have accumulated over a long time
scale, we rarely see these changes in action. The main exception to this is where
there is a strong selective pressure in favour of such a change ± the best example
being some types of antibiotic resistance in bacteria. For example, rifampicin
resistance can be caused by specific mutations in the gene (rpoB) for one of the
subunits of RNA polymerase. Although this is an essential enzyme, and
therefore there are constraints on the mutations that can be tolerated, the use
of rifampicin as an antibiotic provides a selective pressure under which only
those rare mutants with an appropriate rpoB mutation can survive.
A further possibility is exemplified by the change from UUA to UGA, in
Figure 12.1. This is a stop codon (in the standard genetic code), i.e. it causes
termination of protein synthesis (because of the absence of a tRNA that could
recognize it). Such a change will therefore cause a truncated protein, which will
usually have lost activity.
If instead of changing a single base we envisage a situation where a base is
removed, then we have a frameshift mutation. Once the ribosomes pass that
point in the mRNA, they are reading the message in the wrong frame ± and the
translation product will be totally different from that point onwards. Usually
they will encounter a stop codon quite quickly, as the unused reading frames
are generally well supplied with stop codons.
A point mutation may also occur within an exon but outside the coding
region in the 5H or 3H untranslated regions (UTR). One might assume that such
mutations would not cause any discernable differences in the phenotype, but
they may have an effect, because the UTRs have a function, too, although a
less easily predicted one than the coding region. They serve as a type of `bar

212

ANALYSIS OF GENETIC VARIATION

code' specifying parameters such as sorting and stability of the RNA, which is
accomplished by the action of RNA-binding proteins. An alteration to the
mRNA in this region may therefore affect its recognition by such a protein,
which may have a significant effect on the translatability of the mRNA.

12.1.2 Larger-scale variations
In addition to these point mutations, we now recognize that there is a wide range
of larger-scale variations in the structure of the genome. These include deletions,
duplications, insertions, transpositions, inversions, and other rearrangements. Of
particular importance in the context of this chapter is the activity of mobile
genetic elements, including insertion sequences and transposons. Genome sequencing projects have disclosed large numbers of such elements in most
species, where they play an important role in the generation of variation by
inactivation of the genes into which they are inserted; they also provide a
convenient tool for the differentiation of distinct strains and species. Extrachromosomal agents (plasmids and bacteriophages in prokaryotes, retroviruses
in eukaryotes) are also a significant component of variation. In eukaryotic cells,
we also have to recognize the contribution of the prokaryote-derived mitochondria and chloroplasts to the overall genetic make-up of the cell.

12.1.3 Conserved and variable domains
A typical protein can be considered to be composed of a number of regions
with different functions. In many cases, these different regions fold into semiautonomous structures known as domains. Some of these regions are concerned directly with binding to the substrate(s); since the structure of these
regions is essential for the function of the enzyme, it is not surprising that they
show relatively little variation from one species to another. They are referred to
as conserved regions. In Chapter 11, we saw how you can compare protein
sequences to identify conserved domains (or smaller regions known as motifs).
On the other hand, some regions, especially those which do not play a vital role
in the folding of the protein, are much more variable. These often include the
terminal regions, as well as regions connecting separate domains, and other
sequences that form loops protruding from the main body of the folded
protein. The latter are especially important in some viruses (notably HIV)
where they are both hypervariable and immunodominant, i.e. they vary very
extensively and rapidly, and constitute the principal antigen `seen' by the
body's immune system. This makes it extremely difficult to produce effective
vaccines.

12.1

NATURE OF GENETIC VARIATION

213

In some genes, in eukaryotes, there is a clear correlation between the exons in
the gene and the domains in the protein ± for example in immunoglobulins,
each exon in the gene corresponds to a separate functional domain in the
protein. It is likely that the exons evolved, originally, coding for separate
small polypeptides, and subsequently became combined into a single gene
(separated by introns) coding for a larger protein with identifiable domains
corresponding to the originally independent polypeptides. This is supported by
the observation that some proteins, known as mosaics, are composed of several
domains that are related to regions of different proteins. For example, tissue
plasminogen activator (TPA) contains four domains, two of which are related
to a region of plasminogen, and the others to domains in epidermal growth
factor and fibronectin respectively. The occurrence of different proteins (or
genes) formed by various combinations of domains (or exons) is referred to as
domain shuffling (or exon shuffling).
Although bacterial genes do not usually have introns, a similar phenomenon
can occur and give rise to a high degree of variability. In this case, the mosaic
protein in one strain contains a domain that is not related to the sequence found
in other strains of the same species, but is closely related to the sequence
found in a different organism (see Figure 12.2). The inference is that these
organisms have swapped information, so that a part of the gene is replaced
with information from a different source. This contributes a further dimension
to our overall understanding of the dynamic nature of the genome (sometimes
referred to as genome plasticity) ± rather than the genome being an essentially

static structure evolving slowly through minor changes to its sequence, it is
subject to occasional quite major changes and rearrangements.

12.2 Methods for Studying Variation
Ultimately, comparison of complete genome sequences is the only way of
detecting all the possible types of variation that may occur. This may seem to
be an extravagant and unrealistic suggestion, but it is a measure of the speed
with which genome sequence technology is advancing that complete sequences
are already available for more than one strain of several bacterial species (to
say nothing of two human genome sequences), and the global comparison of
the sequence between strains, species, and genera is playing a major role in our
understanding of the evolution of the genome as a whole. So we are not far
from a position when a serious analysis of the differences between, for example,
two closely related bacterial strains would rely on a comparison of the complete genome sequences ± although we should remember that the genome
sequence by itself does not directly explain which of the differences is responsible for the observed variation in the characteristics of the organism. Indeed, if
you had enough spare money, there are no technical obstacles to comparing
your own complete genome sequence with that of your best friend. Again, you
would no doubt find many interesting differences but none that would be likely
to explain why you like different kinds of music.
However, we are not quite at the point yet where genome sequencing would
be an effective routine method of identifying variations between two organisms.
We need quicker methods which are targeted at certain types of changes.

12.2.1 Genomic Southern blot analysis ± restriction
fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs)
One of the mainstays of the analysis of genetic variation is the Southern blot,
which enables us to detect which band on an agarose gel is able to hybridize to
a specific probe. The technique was described in Chapter 8 as a way of verifying
the nature of the insert in a recombinant clone. In that case, there were only a
few bands on the gel. If we digest a total DNA preparation from an organism,
we will usually get so many fragments that they will appear as a smear on the
gel rather than as discrete bands. (We will consider later on, under Pulsed-field
gel electrophoresis, what happens if you use an enzyme that cuts so rarely that
you get only a few very large fragments.) In this situation, Southern blots not
only enable us to identify specific gene fragments, but the method also enables
us to compare the DNA samples according to the pattern of hybridizing bands.

12.2

METHODS FOR STUDYING VARIATION

215

If you use a probe that hybridizes to a DNA sequence that is present as a
single copy in the genome, then you will detect a single band on the Southern
blot. (This assumes that the enzyme used to digest the genomic DNA does not
cut within the region that the probe hybridizes to; if it does, you will get more
bands.) The size of that band (or bands) will be determined by the position of
the restriction sites flanking the detected sequence. If the structure and location
of that gene is the same in each organism tested, then the band will be in the
same position. On the other hand, if there is variation in the distance separating
the two restriction sites, there will be a difference in the size of the fragment,
and you will see a difference in the position of the detected band. This is
referred to as a restriction fragment length polymorphism or RFLP.
There are a variety of changes that can give rise to such a polymorphism (see
Figure 12.3). The most obvious one ± a point mutation causing loss (or gain) of
a specific restriction site ± will usually happen at a very low frequency. Insertions, for example of mobile genetic elements such as insertion sequences, will
make the fragment larger (or paradoxically smaller, if the inserted element
contains a cleavage site for the enzyme used), but this is also likely to be
infrequent unless the flanking sequences contain a preferred target site for

such an element. Deletions will also alter the restriction fragment size, and
since the deletion may remove the restriction site as well, the fragment detected
can be either larger or smaller than the original. In some regions of the genome,
deletions may be relatively common, usually arising from recombination between two homologous, or partly homologous, sequences.
The most useful polymorphisms arise through the duplication or transposition of repetitive sequences. Duplication is often associated with the occurrence of tandem repeated sequences, i.e. a short sequence of bases occurs twice
(or more) in succession. When this region is replicated, mistakes can occur: the
replication machinery may slip back from the second copy to the first, giving
rise to an extra copy of the repeat; or it may (less commonly) slip in the other
direction, causing a reduction in the number of copies. The repeat sequence can
be quite short ± for example just a pair of bases, or even a run of the same base
± in which case the change in the length of the restriction fragment will be small.
PCR-based techniques are then more useful in detecting these changes (see the
section below on VNTR and microsatellites).
If we use a probe that hybridizes to a mobile DNA element such as a
transposon or insertion sequence, then when a copy of that element moves to
a different site on the chromosome we will pick up a new band on the Southern
blot (Figure 12.4). This is a widely used technique for typing bacterial strains
for epidemiological purposes. It should be noted that in this case we are mainly
looking at changes arising from the location of the sequence detected by the
probe, rather than alterations in a specific region of the genome, although the
latter can contribute to the overall polymorphism. We will return to the use of
RFLP typing in Chapter 16.

METHODS FOR STUDYING VARIATION

From the above discussion it will be evident that using Southern blots to
detect RFLPs will mainly identify larger-scale changes in the structure of the
genome, or a specific part of it, and are much less likely to identify minor
sequence changes in a specific gene (unless that change destroys or creates
a restriction site). However, Southern blots, or other hybridization-based
techniques, can be used to detect specific sequence changes. If you use a
small oligonucleotide probe, and high stringency conditions, a single base
change in the target sequence can cause a detectable change in the ability of
the probe to hybridize to the target DNA. This has applications as diverse as
the diagnosis of human genetic disease and the detection of bacterial mutations
causing antibiotic resistance. Generally, however, the probe would be used in
combination with PCR (see below) rather than being applied directly to
genomic DNA.

12.2.2 PCR-based methods
One of the practical limitations of the conventional RFLP method described
above is that it requires a relatively large amount of DNA for the signal to be
detectable. Exactly how much we need depends on the size of the genome. For
a large genome such as ours, you would need 6 mg or so to have enough of each
individual gene to bind enough probe to visualize it. This is acceptable for
many research purposes where it is not difficult to obtain sufficient DNA from
tissues from an animal, or from cells grown in culture. However, for many
practical applications, including forensic examination and many types of clinical diagnosis, this approach is not possible. We have to use PCR to amplify the
tiny amount of DNA that is available, and we then need a different approach
to identify variations.

VNTR and microsatellites
One approach exploits the tandem repeats referred to previously; but instead of
using a probe and a genomic Southern blot, we can amplify the region containing the tandem repeat, using primers that hybridize either side of the tandem
repeats. If we run the product on an agarose or (preferably) acrylamide gel, we
will see that the size of the product varies in a stepwise fashion according to
the number of copies of the repeated sequence (see Figure 12.5). This gives the
technique its name, VNTR standing for Variable Number Tandem Repeats.
Each strain can then be given a number corresponding to the number of
that tandem repeat that is present. By identifying several loci that contain
VNTRs, and determining the number of copies at each position, we arrive at

a composite designation such as 3433243. This is now increasingly used in
genotyping as an alternative to RFLPs.
A very similar concept that has proved extremely useful in genotyping
involves the use of shorter tandem repeats known as microsatellites, or short
tandem repeats (STRs). These are curious short stretches of sequence of 200
bases or less. They look almost as if the genome got bored with randomly
distributed bases and instead decided to go for a straight stretch of one or two
(less commonly three or four) nucleotide bases repeated 100 times or so (such
as TTTTTTTTT . . . . or GTGTGTGTGTGTG . . .). Nobody knows what these
repeats do, but it cannot be particularly important, because they are extremely
variable in length (no doubt because of `slipping' during replication) as well as
randomly distributed throughout the genome, and it is this that makes them so
useful. By performing PCR with a battery of primers flanking microsatellite
markers, a genetic fingerprint can be obtained that makes it possible to draw
conclusions about an individual's identity and genetic relationship with others
with great confidence.

Sequence polymorphisms
For typing or fingerprinting, methods based on RFLPs or VNTR and microsatellites are often satisfactory. However, for other purposes, their inability to
specifically detect minor changes at sequence level is a serious limitation. In
addition, much of the time we are looking at the structure of DNA sequences
that do not carry any coding information, or changes that are neutral in their
affect on the phenotype. Indeed, the neutrality of the changes is, unsurprisingly, connected with the frequency of occurrence which makes those methods
useful for typing. However, if we want to look at the structure of genes that

12.2

219

METHODS FOR STUDYING VARIATION

code for important functions ± such as testing for the presence of genetic
diseases ± we will often need other methods to test for the presence of those
changes.
There are other reasons, too, for wanting to detect these sequence polymorphisms, related to the use of these techniques for studying evolutionary relationships between organisms. For molecular typing, where we are considering
whether two samples match or not, we do not need to know the rate at which
the fingerprint changes (the `molecular clock') ± the rate is likely to be so low
that an individual's `fingerprint' remains constant. We do need to know how
likely it is that a match might occur by chance, but that estimate can be
obtained empirically by examining large numbers of fingerprints. However,
for evolutionary analysis, and the study of the phylogenetic relationships
between organisms (e.g. how far in the past did they diverge from a common
ancestor?), we do require an estimate of the clock speed ± or at the very least
confidence that there is a constant molecular clock, which may well not be true
for some data such as that based on RFLP patterns for insertion sequences. We
can illustrate this by reference to Figure 12.6. Here we can see that A and B are
more similar to one another than either is to C, and a computer program will
generate a dendrogram to display that relationship visually. However, unless
we know that the rate of variation is constant, we should not jump to the
conclusion that C diverged from a common ancestor of A and B, and that the
difference between A and B happened more recently. If for some reason
variation has occurred more rapidly in C (and its ancestors) than in A and B,
then C might have diverged more recently, but has undergone more rapid
variation since.
We are on somewhat safer ground with sequence polymorphisms, where we
can get some estimate of the current rate of variation in each organism, and the
assumption of a constant rate is rather more meaningful (although it should be
treated with caution as we know that mutation rates do vary between organisms). Note that for evolutionary analysis we would normally focus on synonymous substitutions (to avoid complications arising from advantageous or

disadvantageous mutations) whereas for other purposes such as study or
diagnosis of human genetic disease we would by definition be looking for
mutations that affected the function of that gene. We should stress that the
construction of a true phylogenetic tree for a number of strains or species is
much more complicated than the simple example shown; there will be a very
large number of possible trees, and more complex forms of analysis are needed
to be able to produce a tree that can be claimed to represent the true evolutionary relationship between the strains or species.

Direct sequencing
The principle here is to amplify the gene, or a suitable fragment of it, and to
sequence the PCR product. For studying a human genetic disease, you would
then compare this sequence in individuals with or without the condition.
However, things are not necessarily that simple. For example, you may find a
change at one position in all the patients compared to all the controls. That
does not necessarily mean that you have identified the cause of the disease.
Assuming this is an inherited condition, that change may be genetically linked
to another elsewhere on the same gene or on a neighbouring gene. On the other
hand, you may find that not all the patients have the same mutation. What
presents as a single condition may in fact be due to any one of several mutations. For example, the human eye disease retinitis pigmentosa can be caused
by no less than 90 different mutations in the rhodopsin gene; but it could also
be caused by any one of hundreds of other mutations in dozens of other genes.
Similar considerations would apply to studying for example the genetic basis
of rifampicin resistance in bacteria. It is known that this is commonly caused by
mutation in the rpoB gene (coding for a subunit of RNA polymerase). Sequence analysis of the PCR-amplified rpoB gene from different strains identifies a number of variations, some of which are only present in rifampicinresistant strains. If this remains true after sequencing a larger number of
strains, you can become increasingly confident that these mutations include
those responsible for rifampicin resistance. In this case you have the advantage
of being able to test the hypothesis experimentally, by deliberately introducing
each of those mutations (by allelic replacement, see Chapter 14) into a rifampicin sensitive strain and seeing if it does become resistant. There is still the
limitation that you are likely to find some strains that are resistant to rifampicin but do not have any of these mutations; this indicates that there is another
mechanism that you have not identified.
Another possibility that you will have to keep in mind in a diploid organism
is that the mutation may affect the binding site for one of the PCR primers. In
that case, in a heterozygote, the mutant allele will fail to amplify. On the other
hand, the wildtype allele will amplify perfectly, and give you the incorrect

12.2

METHODS FOR STUDYING VARIATION

221

impression that you are dealing with a homozygous wildtype. In these cases,
RFLP analysis remains a valuable tool to ensure that there are no major
deletions or other rearrangements in your gene of interest.

Allele-specific oligonucleotide probes
If you are confident that you have identified all the possible mutations, then
using sequencing to identify them is rather unnecessary. In this case it is
possible to make a pair of short oligonucleotides, one of which will hybridize
(under stringent conditions) only to the mutated form, and the other only to
the corresponding wild type. The pair of probes can then be used to test the
PCR amplified product for the presence of that mutation. This is normally
done using yet another variation of filter hybridization ± dot or slot blot, where
you pipette all your PCR amplicons from the individuals you are testing in a
row on one membrane for each probe that you are using. You can either do this
by hand, each pipetted drop forming a dot, or you can use a dot or slot blot
manifold, through which your sample will be transferred onto the membrane
by vacuum suction in a geometrically defined pattern. Since a defined amount
is applied to the membrane, it is possible to obtain a quantitative result, using
densitometry to assess the strength of the signal obtained after hybridization
with the probe. If the number of known mutations is too large to make this
approach feasible, you can produce an array (see later in this chapter), with
each oligonucleotide immobilized on a membrane or a glass slide, and hybridize it to your PCR-amplified sample. In this case, the PCR product would be
labelled, rather than the oligonucleotides.
Quicker and more sensitive results can be obtained by combining this
concept with that of real-time PCR, in which specific fluorescent probes are
used to monitor the progress of the PCR reaction as it happens. If these
probes are designed to detect a specific mutation, you have a sensitive and
rapid test for that specific lesion. Real-time PCR is described more fully in
Chapter 13.

SSCP
The mobility of a DNA (or RNA) molecule in an electrophoresis gel is
determined not solely by its length but also by its conformation, or shape.
Most electrophoresis of DNA fragments is concerned with linear doublestranded DNA (such as restriction fragments or PCR products), in which
case the conformation is relatively uniform, and the assumption that DNA
length is the determining factor is sufficiently valid. However, single-stranded
nucleic acids are a different matter. The bases are hydrophobic, but are

222

ANALYSIS OF GENETIC VARIATION

removed from the aqueous environment by folding the nucleic acid into a
complex series of stem-loop structures and even more complex forms (see
Chapter 2). The way in which it folds will be influenced by its sequence; even
a single base change can have a significant effect on the overall conformation ±
and hence on its mobility in gel electrophoresis. This is why sequencing gels
(Chapter 10) are run under denaturing conditions, as in this case separation
strictly according to molecular weight is required. Conversely, if we run this
single-stranded fragment on a non-denaturing gel (i.e. we keep the temperature
low enough to prevent it from unfolding), we can detect even single base
substitutions in the DNA by a change in the position of the resulting band.
This technique is known as single-strand conformational polymorphism, or
SSCP.
SSCP can be especially useful for detecting the presence of sequence polymorphisms in specific regions of the genome, although the increase in the
power of automated sequencers has reduced the necessity for using SSCP ± it
is often easier now to sequence the region directly (and this is what you would
have to do anyway to confirm the findings from the SSCP analysis). However,
the throughput of SSCP is higher.

12.2.3 Genome-wide comparisons
All the above methods are based on the examination of variation in limited
regions of the genome. For example, even with a method such as RFLP
fingerprinting of bacteria using an insertion sequence, where the insertion
sites giving rise to the polymorphism may be more or less randomly distributed
over the whole chromosome, the actual regions involved in the comparison of
two strains represent less than 1 per cent of the whole chromosome. Short of
complete sequencing of all the genomes to be compared (see the discussion
earlier in this chapter), how can we look at the global structure of the genome?

Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis
In principle, you might expect that since a restriction endonuclease will cut
genomic DNA at defined positions, you would get a characteristic pattern of
restriction fragments from a given strain. Any deletions, insertions or transpositions (and some base substitutions) would give rise to a change in that
pattern ± and in principle you would be correct. However, if we consider an
enzyme that requires a six-base recognition sequence (a `six-base cutter') then,
assuming an equal proportion and random distribution of all four bases, we
would expect this enzyme to cut on average once every 4096 (46 ) bases. If you

12.2

METHODS FOR STUDYING VARIATION

223

are working with a bacterial genome of, say, 4 million (4 Â 106 ) bases, you
would expect about 1000 fragments. Agarose gel electrophoresis does not have
enough resolving power to separate out such a large number of fragments
(although it is possible, albeit extremely difficult, to obtain characteristic
patterns for typing using only a part of the range of sizes). For organisms
with larger genomes, the problem is of course correspondingly greater.
There are enzymes available that will cut DNA less frequently because they
have a longer recognition sequence and/or a recognition site that occurs less
frequently than expected on a random distribution. Such an enzyme will
produce fewer fragments, but the problem now is that the fragments are too
big to be separated by conventional gel electrophoresis. These large fragments
will actually move through the gel, but in a size-independent manner. This is
most easily visualized as considering the DNA fragments as very long and very
thin structures; once they eventually get lined up end-on, parallel to the direction of the electric field, they can then slide through the pores in the gel. As long
as the field direction is constant, they will keep moving. The limiting factor is
the time taken to orientate the molecules.
The technique of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) exploits this. The
simplest version to describe is one where the polarity of the electric field is
briefly reversed periodically throughout the run (Figure 12.7). Each time the
field is reversed, the molecule has to be re-orientated in order to move through
the pores in the opposite direction, and the longer the molecule is, the slower
this process will be. Consequently, the net migration of the fragments through
the gel will be size-dependent just as a gel with smaller fragments would have
been. (In reality, this approach leads to unacceptable distortions of the lanes,

ANALYSIS OF GENETIC VARIATION

and the apparatus actually used for PFGE employs more complex systems for
changing field direction in order to achieve straight and coherent lane patterns.)
Successful application of PFGE requires the isolation of genomic DNA
intact or at least as extremely large fragments. This is virtually impossible by
conventional means, as the DNA tends to fragment when the cells are lysed.
Instead, intact cells are embedded in agarose, and both lysis and restriction
digestion are carried out in a plug of agarose excised from the initial block. The
agarose plug is then inserted into the gel and the DNA fragments migrate from
the plug into the gel proper during electrophoresis.
PFGE has been employed for bacterial typing, but the technical demands of
the process make it less popular than the other methods described. It should be
noted, however, that it does provide a method (although not the only one) for
the preparative separation of chromosomes from eukaryotic cells.

Microarrays
A more recent, and much more widely useful, approach to the analysis of whole
genomes is to employ microarrays. This involves the production of a series of
PCR products (or synthetic oligonucleotides) which correspond to all the
predicted genes from a specific organism. Or, for analysis of small genomes,
you could use sequences spaced at regular intervals over the whole genome. To
provide reasonable coverage of the whole genome you would need thousands
of such fragments for a bacterial genome, or millions for an organism with a
larger genome. A robot is used to produce tiny spots of each fragment in a
precisely defined pattern on a treated glass slide. This is the microarray. Once
the fragments are made and the machine is set up, it can produce many
identical copies of the same microarray.
For genomic analysis, you would then produce labelled genomic DNA from
the organism to be tested, and allow it to hybridize to the microarray. All the
sequences in the microarray that are represented in the target organism will
result in a positive signal; deletions will show up as the absence of a signal
(Figure 12.8). This is therefore a very effective way of detecting insertions and
deletions (indels) in different strains or individuals, and identifying the genes,
or chromosomal regions, that are affected by each deletion.
An alternative to this global approach is to use a microarray of oligonucleotide sequences representing all the known mutations or polymorphisms in a
gene, allowing a quick screen in cases where there are many potential differences such as the range of rhodopsin mutations as described above.
Microarrays are also used extensively for genome-wide analysis of gene
expression, including the effect of different growth environments, or to trace

13 Analysis
of Gene
Expression
Gene expression can be divided into two main phases: transcription (copying
DNA into RNA), and translation (production of a protein or polypeptide to
the specifications of an mRNA template). For the purpose of this chapter, we
will assume that the polypeptide chain is the end product of gene expression:
this ignores subsequent post-translational modification, including the folding
of the polypeptide into the correct conformation for biological activity, as well
as other modifications such as the specific addition of carbohydrate groups.
Assessment of this part of the process requires specific assays for functional
activity, and the factors involved are considered further in Chapter 15.
The first methods that were developed allowed investigators to study the
expression of a specific RNA or a specific protein. Gradually, methods became
available that also made it possible to compare increasingly complex mixtures
of gene products. Recent advances in technologies have increased these possibilities even further, prompting scientists to create new terms for these types of
analysis, although conceptually they are not new. The complete collection of
mRNA transcripts in a cell, tissue, or organism at a particular time is referred
to as the transcriptome (by analogy with the genome, which is the complete set
of genetic information). Thus, the comparative study of mRNA transcripts
would be called transcriptomics. The complete set of translated proteins is
called the proteome and the global study of translated proteins is called proteomics. Both for the study of mRNA and protein, we will begin by discussing
methods for the study of the products of single genes, and then extend these to
the study of complex samples.

13.1 Analysing Transcription
The first group of techniques for examining gene expression consists of various
ways of assessing the amount of a specific transcript in a specific sample at a
specific time. Other methods, described later in the chapter, are concerned with
studying the transcriptional activity associated with the gene in question. Two

228

ANALYSIS OF GENE EXPRESSION

points concerning the measurements of mRNA levels should be noted. First,
the amount of a specific mRNA in a cell at a point in time is influenced not only
by the level of transcriptional activity but also by the stability of that message.
A gene that is transcribed at a low level but gives rise to a stable product may
result in a higher amount of mRNA than a more active gene with an unstable
message. Second, the amount of mRNA present does not necessarily correlate
with the amount of protein made. This is most obvious with bacterial cells,
where a single polycistronic message may be translated into many different
polypeptides; although these are all translated from the same mRNA template,
the levels of the different proteins made can be widely different. Translation
efficiencies can vary considerably.

13.1.1 Northern blots
The oldest methods for detecting specific mRNA rely on hybridization to
specific, labelled, probes. A common manifestation of this is known as a
Northern blot. A Northern blot involves electrophoretic separation of a purified extract of RNA from the cell, followed by immobilization onto a membrane and hybridization with a specific probe, as shown in Figure 13.1. This
enables us to detect the presence of a specific mRNA, assuming that the probe
we use is sufficiently specific, and to estimate its size. By careful calibration, for
example by comparison of the strength of the hybridization signal with that of
other genes that are expressed at known levels, we can get an idea of the relative
level of expression of the gene in question (or more accurately, the relative
amount of mRNA present). In Figure 13.1, we can see that sample B gave a

weaker signal than sample A, and therefore contained much less of the specific
mRNA, while in sample C expression of the gene was not detected. (However,
we have to bear in mind that RNA is readily degraded, especially by ribonuclease contamination, so a weak or absent signal may be due to loss of the
mRNA).
However, there are some limitations to this technique. First, although we can
get a relative quantitative estimate of the strengths of the signals, it is generally
not possible to obtain an absolute measurement of the amount of specific
mRNA.
Second, the technique is not very sensitive, and requires fairly large amounts
of RNA (normally at least a microgram of poly-A-enriched mRNA or ten
micrograms of total RNA). It may not be possible to obtain sufficient quantities of starting material. For example, if we want to look at the expression of
specific genes in a pathogenic bacterium when it is growing within an infected
host (rather than the artificial situation of laboratory culture), or levels of
mRNA in material obtained by biopsy, it is likely to be extremely difficult to
get large enough quantities of mRNA to be able to do a Northern blot.
On the other hand, Northern blotting has some lasting advantages. The risk
of artefacts is much smaller than with the PCR-based methods described below
and, above all, it remains the only method for determining the size of a specific
transcript and for detecting the presence of different transcripts for a specific
gene (e.g. in Figure 13.1, we can see the presence of a second, smaller, transcript
in sample D). This is becoming more important as the human genome project
teaches us that the number of genes is considerably smaller than the number of
gene products. An important part of the explanation for this is that many genes
are differentially spliced, and Northern blotting is a very important tool for
detecting this.

13.1.2 RNase protection assay
This method is based on solution hybridization rather than filter hybridization.
The target is a specific RNA species in a complex RNA mixture purified from a
biological sample. The probe is a radiolabelled antisense RNA. Such RNA
probes can be produced quite easily from plasmid cloning vectors, such as the
pGEM series (Chapter 6) that are equipped with binding sites for RNA
polymerases (T3, T7, and/or Sp6). In the example shown (Figure 13.2), the
gene (or part of it) has been inserted into the vector in the correct orientation
for transcription from the T7 promoter. Addition of T7 RNA polymerase, and
the NTP substrates, will therefore produce the normal (sense strand) RNA.
However, the gene is in the opposite orientation with respect to the SP6
promoter. So, if you use SP6 RNA polymerase, in vitro, it will transcribe the
gene in the wrong direction ± or in other words it will copy the opposite strand.

230

ANALYSIS OF GENE EXPRESSION

The resulting RNA (the antisense RNA) will be complementary to the true
(sense strand) RNA, and will therefore hybridize to it.
When you add the (labelled) antisense RNA to your mRNA preparation, it
will anneal to the specific RNA you want to measure, forming double-stranded
RNA, while non-specific mRNA molecules remain single-stranded. When
ribonuclease (RNase) is added, it will degrade all the single-stranded RNA,
while the double-stranded hybrids formed by annealing the antisense RNA
probe to the specific mRNA are protected (Figure 13.3). After RNase digestion, the hybridization mixture is separated in a polyacrylamide gel. The gel is
then dried and left to expose an X-ray film.
This assay has some distinct advantages over Northern blotting. It is more
sensitive, it is more quantitative, and it is more tolerant of partial degradation
of the RNA samples. The reason for the latter is that only part of the RNA
molecule needs to be intact to take part in the hybridization. This is simultaneously one disadvantage compared with Northern blotting. It does not allow

you to determine the size of the transcript(s), because the band you see in the
gel is only defined by the length of the probe. The other disadvantage is that it
demands more work than Northern blotting in the production of the probe.
However, it certainly is an attractive method if you study one particular gene
extensively.

13.1.3 Reverse transcription PCR
A much more sensitive way of detecting specific mRNA is to adapt the
polymerase chain reaction (PCR, see Chapter 9) so as to be able to amplify
the specific message. Since this requires copying the mRNA into cDNA using
the enzyme reverse transcriptase (see Chapter 7), it is described as reverse
transcription PCR (RT-PCR). The principle of the method is illustrated in
Figure 13.4.
The sensitivity of this procedure is such that it is possible to detect a specific
mRNA in a single cell. This has obvious advantages, in being able to detect low
abundance mRNA (i.e. mRNA that is present at extremely low levels), or to

ANALYSIS OF GENE EXPRESSION

analyse gene expression in cells that are difficult to obtain in large numbers. An
example of the latter is the analysis of gene expression in bacteria from lesions
in an infected animal (or human) to find out which genes are expressed under
those circumstances. Culturing the bacteria is no use, as the gene expression
would change. RT-PCR enables us to analyse gene expression in the limited
number of bacteria recoverable from the lesion.
The sensitivity of RT-PCR confers a further, rather less obvious, advantage.
If we want to look at tissue-specific expression, or at expression in cells under
different physiological conditions (whether bacterial or eukaryotic), we have to
try to ensure that all the cells from which we extract the mRNA are indeed
expressing the same repertoire of genes. The relatively large amounts of mRNA
required for a Northern blot mean that we have to use mRNA extracted from a
number of cells, and this population may actually be heterogeneous. RT-PCR
requires much less mRNA, and hence far fewer cells. It is therefore much more
likely that all the cells are in the same physiological state, and we will therefore
get a much more accurate picture of the true profile of gene transcription in
those cells. Reporter genes (see below) provide an alternative way of addressing
this question.
Conventional RT-PCR still suffers from the other limitation, namely quantification. It is difficult to be sure that you are getting reliable results by simply
amplifying the template and measuring the amount of product. There is no
simple and reliable relationship between the amount of template you start with
and the amount of product formed, unless the PCR reaction is truly proceeding
exponentially. It will cease to do so when the availability of reagents becomes
limiting. This can be overcome, to a point, by adding a known amount of a
second template that is almost identical (and amplifiable with the same
primers) but still distinguishable on an electrophoresis gel. Normally, this is
produced by cloning the PCR product into a plasmid vector and deleting a
small part of it. Adding a known quantity of this modified DNA to the PCR
reaction will allow you to achieve much better quantitative accuracy by comparing the relative amounts of the two resulting PCR products. In practice, this
has now been superseded by the more accurate and simpler method of real-time
PCR, as described in the next section.

Real time RT-PCR
As mentioned above, there is no reliable relationship between the amount of
template added and the ultimate amount of product detected after a fixed
number of cycles. However, there is a more reliable relationship between the
amount of template and the number of cycles of amplification needed to
produce a detectable product. So you could in theory set up a number of

233

13.1 ANALYSING TRANSCRIPTION

Signal

amplification reactions, and stop them after different numbers of cycles and see
which reactions give detectable product. This would be tedious and expensive.
However, if you have a way of detecting the product without interrupting the
series of amplifications, then you have an invaluable way of quantifying the
procedure. This is the basis of real-time PCR.
For real-time PCR, you therefore need a way of detecting the product as it is
formed, without having to stop the reaction and run the products out on a gel.
The simplest method to understand is to add, to the PCR mixture, a dye that
fluoresces when it binds to double-stranded DNA. However, this can lead to
artefacts, as you will get a signal produced even if the wrong product is made.
Greater specificity can be achieved by using probes that will only bind to the
specific product. Using a combination of dyes to label these probes, it is
possible to ensure that fluorescence will only be observed when the probe is
annealed to the target, and not when the probe is free in solution. There are
several quite different ways of doing this.
If you carry out the PCR reaction in a machine that not only performs the
temperature cycling needed for a PCR reaction but will also detect the fluorescence of your samples, then you can monitor the progress of your PCR in real
time. Initially, the template is single-stranded, and so there is no signal. As
amplification proceeds, double-stranded product is formed, and eventually
enough of this product is made to allow the resulting fluorescence to be
detected by the machine (see Figure 13.5). The level of the fluorescence will
increase over a number of cycles, and by extrapolation of the resulting curve
back to zero you can determine the number of cycles needed for formation of a
detectable amount of product. This value, known as the CT value, is related to
the initial amount of template: higher amounts of initial template initially will

result in lower CT values. In the figure, sample A produces a detectable signal
after 20 cycles, so we say it has a CT value of 20. This represents more template
than in samples B (CT  22) or C (CT  25).
If you are comparing the levels of mRNA in different samples, you have to
make sure that you start with the same number of cells, or more specifically
with the same overall amount of mRNA. Standardizing the amount of total
RNA (rather than specifically mRNA) is not completely reliable, as the ribosomal content of the cells can vary considerably. The best way of standardizing
the template is to carry out a parallel RT-PCR using another gene which is
known to be constitutively expressed (or at least expressed at the same level
under the different conditions you are testing).
This enables testing for differences in the specific expression of an individual
gene under different conditions. Can you use the same method to compare the
expression of different genes? Subject to certain safeguards, yes, you can. The
problem to be dealt with is that PCR is not equally efficient with all genes. Even
if the amounts of template are the same, a more efficient PCR will result in
earlier detection (a lower CT value) than for another gene with a less efficient
PCR. Some preparatory work is therefore necessary to ensure that the genes
are amplified equally efficiently, possibly including using different primers to
change the efficiency so that they match. (It should be noted that this consideration also applies to the comparison of your gene with the standard template as
referred to above.)
Real-time PCR is also an important technique in the quantitative detection of
specific DNA sequences, and in the identification of specific alterations in DNA
sequence, including medical diagnostic applications (see Chapters 12 and 16).

13.1.4 In situ hybridization
This is the third type of hybridization that we cover in this book (the other two
being solution and filter hybridization). In this method, the target is found
immobilized within a cell on a microscopic slide. The target could be either
DNA or RNA. The former is often used for gross chromosomal mapping of
genes. A labelled probe is hybridized to cells with metaphase chromosomes. By
using a differentiating counterstain, the investigator can identify the localization of the gene to a specific region of a specific chromosome (see Chapter 16
for a more detailed account). What we are concerned with here is RNA in situ
hybridization which, by contrast, can be used to identify which cells, for
example in a tissue section, produce mRNA for a specific gene. In situ hybridization is also used for the detection of viruses. In this case, the target is either
DNA or RNA depending on the pathogen.
Although it is possible to obtain some quantitative information by counting
the number of grains (when using radioactive labels), quantification is not the

13.1 ANALYSING TRANSCRIPTION

235

strength of this method. Rather, its strength is to tell us which particular cell
types express a specific transcript. By using a panel of RNA samples from
different tissues, other methods such as Northern blot hybridization, RNAse
protection assay, and RT-PCR can tell us in which tissue(s) expression takes
place. In situ hybridization allows us to refine this analysis even further. In
addition, the size of the sample required is, of course, minimal.

13.1.5 Primer extension assay
As part of the study of gene expression, we are likely to want to know, not only
how much of a specific mRNA is made, but where does it start and stop.
Studying the 3H end of a eukaryotic mRNA species is rarely a problem. Most
cDNA libraries are constructed by oligo-dT priming of poly-A-enriched
mRNA, so by definition this is the part of the mRNA molecule that is always
employed for cDNA synthesis (although, occasionally, the primer ends up
binding to an adenosine-rich stretch within the mRNA molecule instead).
However, as mentioned earlier (Chapter 7), the 5H end is not always incorporated into the cDNA. The reverse transcription of the full mRNA may not occur
because of degradation of the template, or because of secondary structures or
the presence of RNA-binding proteins that stop the reverse transcriptase.
Moreover, studying the sequence of a cDNA will not necessarily tell us if its
5H end goes all the way to the transcription start site or not. We can establish
whether the whole open reading frame for the protein product is present, but
that is pretty much it. Comparing the length of your cDNA sequence with the
size of the full transcript as seen on a Northern blot will give you an idea of
whether you are dealing with a gene with multiple transcripts (which may vary
in which exons are included or in the length of their untranslated regions), and
the approximate size of the transcript(s).
The primer extension assay is used for the exact mapping of the 5H terminus
of an mRNA. Poly-A RNA is purified from a tissue or cell type known to be
expressing the gene in question at as high a level as possible. This complex
mixture of all the mRNA species present is then mixed with a radiolabelled
oligonucleotide primer complementary to a region close to the 5H end of the
sequence (as you know it), which will also need to be as specific as possible for
the transcript you are studying. Reverse transcriptase is then added and used to
extend the primer to the very 5H end of the mRNA, at which point the
polymerization automatically terminates. You will then need to run out the
new radioactive cDNA strand in a sequencing gel for optimum resolution, and
by running alongside a sequencing reaction of the same gene you are studying,
starting with the same primer, you will be able to identify the transcription start
site down to the very first base (see Figure 13.6). Fluorescent labels can now be
used to perform the same procedure in an automated sequencer.

13.2 Comparing Transcriptomes
Methods such as Northern blotting are really only suitable if we want to
compare the expression of a small number of genes, which would usually be
genes that we were already specifically interested in for some reason. Northern
blotting can be ± and has been ± used for the identification of disease genes
when a limited number of strong candidate genes were known. We commonly
want to identify genes that are expressed in one organism but not in another, or
are tissue-specific, or are differentially expressed under varying environmental
conditions. Over the years a number of techniques have been developed for
comparing which mRNA species are expressed in different samples. Such
methods are able to answer some very important questions. They can tell us
which particular gene is causing a degenerative disease by comparing diseased
and healthy tissue. They can tell us which genes of a pathogenic bacterium
are expressed during infection of a suitable host, as opposed to those that are
expressed in laboratory culture. In some cases, these methods have been superseded by the advent of array-based hybridization techniques (see below); in
other cases, they are still in use.

13.2

237

COMPARING TRANSCRIPTOMES

13.2.1 Differential screening
The most primitive method for identifying cloned genes that are differentially
expressed is by using differential screening of a gene library (see Figure 13.7).
This involves producing two identical filters containing DNA imprints of the
gene library (either by repeated transfer from the same plate, or by transfer
from two identical plates produced by replica plating). Each of the two complex mRNA mixtures that we wish to compare is used to produce a probe by
performing a reverse transcription in the presence of radiolabelled nucleotides.
One of the filters is hybridized with one of these pools of radioactive cDNA,
while the second pool is used to probe the second filter. Clones that show a
positive signal with one probe but not the other are candidate clones of
differentially expressed genes.
This description assumes that the specific transcript is completely absent
from one sample (sample A in Figure 13.7). However, genes are not necessarily
turned off that absolutely; there may still be a small amount of the specific
mRNA present. This might result in a different intensity of some spots with the
two probes, and we could use that for our differential screening. However, the
situation is rather better than that. If there is only a very small amount of a

specific mRNA species (a very low abundance), then the amount of the
corresponding cDNA in the probe will be too low to produce a visible signal.
Furthermore, the synthesis of cDNA is likely to be more efficient for the highabundance mRNA, leading to even further depression of the signal from the
low-abundance species. So any low-abundance mRNA in sample A will give,
not just a weak signal, but no signal at all. This actually causes a problem in
some cases, in that mRNA species that are less abundant, but are still differentially expressed, may not be detectable in either sample. RT-PCR can be used
to generate more representative cDNA probes, but the more representative the
probes become, the more difficult it is to pick up differential expression where
the ratio between the two sources is not high.

13.2.2 Subtractive hybridization
An alternative procedure is to remove the common sequences from the probe,
leaving only those which are present in the test material; this is known as
subtractive hybridization, and is illustrated in Figure 13.8. We are looking for
transcripts that are present in one sample (which is called the tester) but are
absent from the other (the driver). For example, the driver may be derived from
diseased cells so we would like to identify the gene that is unable to be expressed

in those cells; the tester would then come from normal cells. Alternatively, we
could be interested in genes that are only expressed under certain conditions,
for example bacterial genes that are switched on during anaerobic growth, in
which case the driver is the `normal' sample. Whichever way round we look at
it, the procedure is designed to find mRNA that is present in the tester and not
in the driver.
The details of the procedure vary, but in the example shown the first step is
to produce cDNA copies of the mRNA from both samples. The cDNA from
the driver is labelled with biotin (in the figure it is shown as end-labelled for
clarity, whereas in practice the biotin will be incorporated throughout the
molecule). Biotin has strong affinity for streptavidin, so all the molecules
containing biotin can be easily removed. The next step is to mix a large excess
of the biotin-labelled driver cDNA with the tester cDNA, and to denature and
reanneal the mixture. Any tester cDNA that is complementary to driver cDNA
will form hybrid molecules, with one tester strand and one driver strand. Since
the driver strand carries biotin, it can be removed by streptavidin (together
with any excess driver±driver double-stranded DNA). You will then be left
with a mixture that is enriched for those tester cDNA molecules that are
unique, i.e. they are not present in the driver population.
The subtracted tester transcripts can be used as a probe for screening a gene
library. However, that way you only have one shot at enjoying the fruits of
your labour. Moreover, rare transcripts are unlikely to yield any detectable
signals even though they may be the ones you are looking for. A better method
is to produce a subtractive cDNA library by adding adaptors, and ligating the
tester cDNA into a vector. This library is then available for repeated testing,
either by systematic analysis of all clones, or by comparative screening of
duplicate lifts with labelled tester and driver cDNA. This method has been
used successfully on a number of occasions for the identification of disease
genes, by using a wild-type source as the tester and cells from the disease
phenotype (lacking a specific gene product) to generate the driver.
One disadvantage of this procedure is that it requires relatively large
amounts of mRNA. The use of PCR, combined with the principles of the
above procedure, provides a range of more powerful methods. One such
procedure, known as representational difference analysis (RDA) is illustrated
in Figure 13.9. In this example, linkers are ligated to the ends of the cDNA to
provide priming sites for PCR analysis. In the first part of the procedure, the
tester and driver samples are treated in the same way. Then after removing
the initial linkers from the PCR products, a different pair of linkers is added
to the tester PCR product, but not to the driver product. When the two
products are mixed and allowed to anneal (again using a large excess of driver),
any DNA strands that are present in both samples will anneal to form a hybrid
molecule, while the unique tester strands, which will not be able to anneal to the
excess driver DNA, will form specific tester±tester molecules. These can be

amplified by subsequent PCR using primers that are specific for the linkers that
were added only to the tester DNA, which will thus undergo exponential
amplification. Any driver±driver molecules (not shown) will fail to amplify,
because they lack this primer-binding site. The tester±driver hybrids carry
unpaired ends (from the linkers that were added to the tester molecules), and
these can be removed by digestion with a nuclease that is specific for singlestranded DNA (such as mung bean nuclease).

13.2.3 Differential display
Differential display is a PCR-based method of comparing two cDNA populations. One primer is designed to bind to the poly-A tail, while the other is a

13.2

COMPARING TRANSCRIPTOMES

241

random sequence. By running PCR at a very low annealing temperature, a
subpopulation of the cDNA molecules in the sample is amplified. This subpopulation will be small enough to be resolved in a polyacrylamide gel. If you
perform identical PCR reactions with two cDNA populations, you will be able
to identify cDNA species that are expressed at different levels in the two
samples, or even completely absent in one of them. These can then be excised
from the gel, reamplified, and sequenced. If novel, their full sequence can be
obtained by library screening or by RACE (see Chapter 9).
The presence of these cDNA species amongst the amplified mixture is a
random event governed by the degree of sequence similarity with the primers;
the method itself does not favour the amplification of differentially expressed
messages. Thus, a considerable number of primer combinations will have to be
tried, and even so, the analysis will be far from exhaustive. Nonetheless,
although nicknamed `differential dismay' by some frustrated practitioners,
the PCR-based nature of this method carries some specific advantages, including the use of small amounts of starting material, and the ability to identify
differential expression even of very rare transcripts. However, this procedure
has been largely supplanted by more sophisticated techniques such as representational difference analysis (RDA) as described above, or by array technology (see below).

13.2.4 Array-based methods
The development of methods such as subtractive hybridization allowed scientists to pan for differentially expressed gene products, rather than merely
examining the expression of a specific gene. Often, the objective has been to
search for a specific disease gene, or one or a few genes whose products fulfil a
particular role. Methods such as Northern blotting or RT-PCR can be used to
investigate if one or a few candidate genes fulfil our criteria, but they are not
suitable for analysing a large number of genes. Even more importantly, they
can only be used for genes that we already know about. With the rapid
development of genome sequencing, it becomes possible to ask not only such
specific questions, but also global ones: can we identify the complete spectrum
of genes that are expressed under certain conditions and not otherwise?
This can be done using arrays, as described previously (Chapter 12) . In this
case, however, the spots of DNA are allowed to hybridize with labelled cDNA.
Those DNA spots corresponding to an expressed gene will yield a positive
signal. Using machines to produce many identical copies of the array, you can
test for the presence of a wide range of specific cDNA molecules derived from
cells from different environments.
Conceptually, this is not really different from differential screening. Subtractive cDNA libraries in plasmid vectors have often been painstakingly

242

ANALYSIS OF GENE EXPRESSION

picked clone by clone and inoculated in a grid formation on an agar plate, and
duplicate colony lifts used for their analysis. The advent of robotic picking and
high-density spotting technology, and of electronic image analysis, not only
made it technically simpler to produce such arrays, but also largely eliminated
the desirability to limit the array to a subpopulation of particularly suspect
transcripts. Furthermore, knowledge of the complete genome sequence of an
organism makes it possible to produce arrays of small DNA fragments (either
synthetic or generated by a series of PCR reactions) that will identify every
predicted ORF. Such whole genome arrays are now available for a number of
bacterial species (see below).

Expressed sequence tag (EST) arrays
The simplest way to produce a cDNA array is to plate an unamplified cDNA
library, say from the pancreas, and pick the clones one by one. This has its
distinctive disadvantages, however. First, the use of your array will be restricted to samples from one tissue. Your array will have limited use with
samples from brain tissue, for example, because the brain and the pancreas
will have their specific repertoires of genes which are expressed in either tissue
but not in both.
Second, when you made your library, you were wise to base it on poly-Aenriched mRNA (if you were working with a eukaryote), thus avoiding a
library where 95 per cent of the material consists of endlessly repeated rRNA
and tRNA sequences. However, even so you will have quite a lot of repetition.
This is because the frequency of any given gene in a cDNA library (unlike a
genomic library) is biased according to the levels of expression of that particular gene. Thus, you will find major components such as structural genes (e.g.
tubulin), housekeeping genes (e.g. metabolic enzymes), and major tissuespecific products (e.g. insulin) greatly over-represented in your library.
A project that has simultaneously helped us towards independence of tissuespecific libraries and overcoming the problem of over-representation is the
development of expressed sequence tags (ESTs). ESTs are cDNA clones
where a laboratory equipped with a robot has done just what we outlined
above, picked every clone from a library. This has been done with libraries
from many different tissues, creating a sort of transcriptome fingerprint for
each one of them. They have all been subjected to one sequencing run, yielding
a few hundred (unconfirmed) bases from one end, numbered, and archived
jointly in large public facilities. The sequence tag database is available through
GENBANK, so that you can search it for similarity to a gene you are interested
in, and obtain the clones for a nominal charge.

13.2

COMPARING TRANSCRIPTOMES

243

Systematic computer comparison has made it possible to identify which
cDNA clones are unique. It is thus possible to produce cDNA arrays with
non-redundant clones. By spotting these onto a membrane (macroarray) or a
glass slide (microarray), resources have been created that enable simultaneous
study of the majority of the genes in the human, mouse, and rat genomes,
independently of the sequencing of these genomes. The label of choice of
macroarrays is 33 P (providing better resolution than 32 P), and the labelling is
then captured by a phosphoimager. For microarrays, fluorescent labels are
used, and the data are collected by specialized microarray readers. A virtually
unlimited number of copies of each array can be produced at a negligible
marginal cost. Thus, by obtaining a pair of identical arrays, and screening
them with labelled tester and driver cDNA populations, you can in one experiment collect more data than many months of differential display analysis
would have given you.

PCR product arrays
One objective of the EST programme was to try to obtain at least one clone
representing each gene. Although, in the case of the human genome, this
objective was not quite achieved, ESTs have been immensely helpful in the
task of identifying those genes that were represented, and their open reading
frames. Some genes, however, lack EST correlates. In addition, in the cases of
those that do, the method of spotting bacterial clones carrying plasmids is far
from ideal. Inevitably, some eukaryotic probes will have high enough sequence
similarity to these to bind non-specifically to the array.
In bacteria, by contrast, ESTs are not available. However, we now know the
entire genome sequence for a number of bacteria (see Chapter 10), making
possible another even more efficient approach for array production. Computer
methods are used first of all to identify all the open reading frames above a
certain size; these are the predicted genes. For each predicted gene, we use the
computer to design a pair of primers that will amplify a suitably sized region of
that gene. Automated DNA synthesizers are used to make each of these
primers, and robotic methods are used to carry out the thousands of PCR
reactions needed to make the DNA fragments, which are then robotically
spotted onto macro- or microarrays.
Mammalian genomes are much larger, of course, but the same method will
make it possible to produce a complete array of PCR-amplified products
covering all the genes in the entire human genome now that it has been
sequenced. A virtually complete array for the human genome may be available
by the time this book is published.

244

ANALYSIS OF GENE EXPRESSION

Important factors in array hybridization
Note that array hybridization is in effect the reverse of conventional hybridization. The conventional techniques involve attaching the target DNA or RNA
to a filter (e.g. by Southern or Northern blots, or by using dot blots), and then
hybridizing that filter with a specific labelled probe. With macro- or microarrays, the specific fragments are attached, unlabelled, to the solid phase, and
they are hybridized with the labelled target molecule.
The production of arrays requires a high initial investment. Not only does it
require expensive equipment, but also the synthesis of the large number of PCR
primers, and the carrying out of large numbers of PCR reactions, is costly.
However, once you (or someone else) has got to that stage, large numbers of
arrays can be made; the subsequent hybridization and reading of the results is
much less expensive, in particular for macroarrays which can even, to a degree,
be interpreted with the naked eye without access to special imaging equipment.
The actual production of arrays therefore tends to be limited to a few public
and commercial centres, while a larger number of laboratories are capable of
using the microarrays for their own projects.
All the variants of differential and subtractive hybridization and screening
are subject to unreliability and artefacts. They are unlikely to ever completely
replace conventional hybridization methods, which still need to be employed
for unambiguous confirmation of array data, and for providing information
about the corresponding transcripts.

13.3 Methods for Studying the Promoter
13.3.1 Reporter genes
There are a variety of situations where even the most sophisticated of the above
approaches is inadequate or inconvenient for following the nature of gene
expression. For example, if we are investigating cellular differentiation in a
multi-cellular organism, we might want to ask in which cells, or in which
tissues, certain genes start to be expressed, and at what stage of development.
An alternative approach involves the use of reporter genes. Reporter gene
studies are also very important in the analysis of a promoter and its transcription factors (see below), and are a crucial preamble to the construction of a
transgenic organism (Chapter 17).
Reporter gene analysis involves the use of gene cloning technology to make a
construct in which a DNA sequence upstream from a specific gene, including
the promoter and some potential regulatory signals, is attached to another gene
that codes for a readily detectable product (the reporter). Examples of com-

13.3 METHODS FOR STUDYING THE PROMOTER

245

monly used reporters include beta-galactosidase (detected using a chromogenic
or fluorogenic substrate), green fluorescent protein (a naturally fluorescent
protein, originally from a jellyfish), or firefly luciferase (where enzymatic activity is detected by the emission of visible light). The simplest procedure is then to
introduce this construct, carrying a reporter gene driven by a promoter, into the
organism in question. As the cells start to differentiate, those cells in which the
relevant gene is switched on will also switch on the transcriptional signals
attached to the reporter gene, leading to detectable expression of the reporter.
Reporter gene technology therefore provides a powerful way of assessing the
transcriptional state of selected genes in cells or tissues under different conditions or at different stages of growth. Even if expression occurs only transiently, so that detection of the mRNA may be difficult, the greater stability of
the reporter protein may allow the identification of the time at which expression is activated. (It follows from this, however, that it is less easy to determine
when expression is switched off.)

13.3.2 Locating the promoter
Reporter genes also provide a useful way of locating the sequences that are
necessary for promoter activity, and for assessing the regulatory functions
associated with upstream sequences (see later). In order to locate the promoter
of a specific gene you can start by cloning fragments of DNA around and
upstream from the transcription start site, using a vector that carries a promoterless reporter gene (this is known as a promoter-probe vector; see Figure
13.10). Alternatively, you can do genome-wide screening for promoters with
specific function, for example by making a library of random DNA fragments
in a promoter-probe vector, and selecting those clones which exhibit expression
of the reporter under the chosen conditions.

ANALYSIS OF GENE EXPRESSION

Promoter-probe vectors are more commonly used in bacterial systems; other
approaches that are more suitable for locating regulatory elements in eukaryotes are considered subsequently. In Chapter 14, we describe the related
technique of enhancer trapping, which involves the use of a transposable
element carrying a reporter gene with a weak promoter. Other approaches
described in this chapter include the yeast one-hybrid system, which is analogous to the promoter-probe approach in enabling the identification of DNA
sequences that interact with known transcription factors. It is also used to
identify DNA-binding proteins that interact with a defined DNA sequence,
and it is in that context that we consider it in this chapter.
The question addressed by promoter-probe analysis is similar to that in
microarray studies of gene expression, except that the latter looks at mRNA
levels while the promoter-probe approach tests for promoter activity. The two
approaches are to some extent complementary; microarrays are a more direct
measure of what actually happens, and directly identify the genes, while
promoter-probes may be more successful in detecting transient and low level
activity. The promoter-probe approach has the further advantage of not
requiring knowledge of the genome sequence, since you can use random
DNA fragments ± but it does not identify the genes concerned. Once you
have detected positive clones, you have more work to do in identifying the
DNA fragment in those clones.
One serious disadvantage of using reporter genes on a plasmid is that the
system is prone to artefacts. Fragments of DNA, taken out of context, may
show quite different effects in their ability to promote transcription. Some
promoters do not work properly (or their regulation is quite different) when
located on a plasmid; conversely, some DNA fragments that produce positive
signals on a promote-probe vector are subsequently found not to be `real'
promoters. Reporter genes, used in either of the above ways, often give more
reliable results when inserted into a specific chromosomal position rather than
in the artificial environment of a plasmid.
One important example of the use of the promoter-probe approach is the
IVET (in vivo expression technology) method for identifying potential virulence
genes in pathogenic bacteria (see Figure 13.11). In the original version of this
procedure, used for identifying in vivo expressed genes in Salmonella typhimurium, the vector contained two promoterless genes (purA and lacZ) and the host
strain was a purA mutant of S. typhimurium (i.e. it had a defect in purine
biosynthesis, which makes it unable to grow in experimental animals). Random
fragments of S. typhimurium DNA were inserted in the vector to produce a gene
library, and the constructs were integrated into the chromosome by homologous recombination (see Chapter 14). When animals were challenged with the
mixture of clones, only those clones with a promoter that was active in this
situation were able to express the purA gene ± thus providing direct selection for
promoters that were active during infection. The promoterless lacZ reporter

gene allowed confirmation of the results; most of the recovered bacteria
contained promoters that were also active in the laboratory, but about 5 per
cent were specifically activated during infection.
Another elegant method for identifying virulence genes, known as signaturetagged mutagenesis, is described in Chapter 14.
The techniques above will identify a DNA fragment that has promoter
activity, but will not tell you which part of that fragment is responsible. You
can extend the approach to provide a more precise identification of the

248

ANALYSIS OF GENE EXPRESSION

sequences that are necessary for promoter activity. At the simplest level, this
could involve making a series of deletions from one or both ends of the
fragment, and seeing how much you can remove without affecting promoter
activity. Other techniques that we will describe later (Chapter 15) can be used
to alter specific bases within the promoter in order to assess the sequence
requirements for initiation of transcription. This approach can also be used
to identify regulatory sequences that affect the activity of the promoter, usually
through binding of regulatory proteins. Subsequent sections in this chapter
examine other methods for investigating the DNA binding of RNA polymerase, transcription factors, and regulatory proteins.

13.3.3 Using reporter genes to study regulatory RNA
elements
Reporter gene assays based on joining a promoter to a reporter gene have been
very useful both for dissecting the components of the promoter and for
quantifying its activation in different situations; but of course there are limitations. If you couple your promoter to a gene that encodes a completely
different protein, your readout will be a function of the intrinsic properties of
that mRNA and of that protein. These include the stability of the mRNA and
the protein, as well as the efficiency of translation. However, as long as you
compare like with like ± the activation of the promoter, as measured by its effect
on reporter gene levels, under different circumstances ± you can make a convincing case that your observations are comparable as a measure of promoter
activation because you are keeping all other parameters constant.
You may, however, especially in eukaryotic systems, wish to study other
parameters that affect the levels of the transcript encoded by your gene, such
as the 5H untranslated region (UTR) and its effect on translation efficiency, or the
3H UTR and its effect on mRNA stability. In these cases, you will wish to keep all
other factors constant, including the promoter. Thus, you choose a vector that
contains your reporter gene under the control of a constitutively active promoter
without cellular or organismal specificity, such as that of the large T antigen of
the SV40 virus. You can then slot the whole or part of your 5H =3H UTR on either
side of your reporter gene. By comparing the amount of reporter gene product in
different constructs, and in the native vector, you are able to gauge the positive
or negative impact of different elements on mRNA translatability.

13.3.4 Regulatory elements and DNA-binding proteins
The most direct, precise and reliable way of locating a promoter, or any other
DNA sequence that influences transcription through the binding of specific

13.3 METHODS FOR STUDYING THE PROMOTER

249

proteins (which includes many but not all regulatory elements) is to detect the
binding of those proteins to specific DNA fragments. Three methods are worth
describing briefly: yeast one-hybrid assays, DNase I footprinting and gel
retardation assays.

Yeast one-hybrid assays
The purpose of the yeast one-hybrid system is to identify proteins that interact
with a defined DNA sequence, or conversely to locate DNA regions that will
bind to known transcription factors. In the example illustrated in Figure 13.12,
tandem copies of the DNA sequence under investigation (known as the bait)
are inserted upstream from a reporter gene. This construct is then integrated
into the yeast genome. In the absence of transcription factors that bind to the
bait, the reporter gene will not be expressed (Figure 13.12(a)). However, if you
transform the recombinant yeast strain with a cDNA expression library, any
clones that express a transcription factor that can interact with the bait will
activate transcription of the reporter gene (Figure 13.12(b)).
The versatility of the system can be extended by exploiting the bipartite
nature of eukaryotic transcription factors. This means that in general they
consist of two domains: one part of the protein (the DNA-binding domain)
makes specific contacts with certain DNA sequences, while the other part (the
activation domain) is responsible for activating transcription. These domains
can be separated, and function independently, so the activation domain (AD)

can be joined to other DNA-binding proteins, when it will activate transcription from other sites according to the specificity of the new DNA-binding
domain. The best example is the yeast activator GAL4, which normally controls the transcription of genes involved in galactose metabolism. If the DNAbinding domain of GAL4 is removed and replaced with another DNA-binding
domain, the hybrid protein will activate transcription of a different set of genes.
To take advantage of this, the cDNA library is made using a special vector
containing the GAL4 AD so that the products will be expressed as fusion
proteins with the GAL4 AD. If the product binds to the bait sequence, the
GAL4 AD will activate transcription of the reporter (Figure 13.12(c)). Since
the activation is provided by the GAL4 AD, this system can detect a wider
range of DNA-binding proteins, and is not limited to those that are themselves
transcription factors.
An extension of this concept, the yeast two-hybrid system, is used to study
protein±protein interactions, and is considered in Chapter 14.

DNase I footprinting
In DNase I footprinting (or just footprinting), you identify which part of the
suspected promoter sequence binds to transcription factor proteins. Nuclei are
isolated from whole cells (whether a cultured cell line or a whole tissue), and
proteins isolated from the nuclei. These proteins, or a specific protein purified
from the mixture, are then mixed with the DNA fragment you wish to analyse.
A parallel control reaction contains DNA without protein. In both reactions,
the DNA is radiolabelled at the 3H end. You then add the nuclease DNase I to
both reactions. DNase I will cleave all the phosphodiester bonds in the DNA
chain that it can reach. The reaction is not allowed to go to completion; thus, as
a result, the DNA in your control reaction will be fragmented randomly into a
continuous ladder of DNA fragments of all possible sizes between full size and
one base. However, in the other reaction, DNase I will be unable to access its
substrate wherever a cis-acting DNA element has been protected by a bound
trans-acting protein. Thus, if you run these two samples out on a sequencing gel
side by side, you will find that the continuous ladder as seen in the control is
interrupted in these protected regions (Figure 13.13). Since DNase digestion is
random, there will of course be a lot of other products as well as those shown ±
but as you are using autoradiography to detect the label attached to the DNA,
you will only detect those fragments that contain the end of the original DNA
molecule. By running out a sequencing reaction as well, you will be able to tell
exactly which regions of DNA were protected. Note, however, that the extent
of the DNA that is protected by a specific protein is usually considerably larger
than the region that is necessary to make specific contacts with the protein.

Gel retardation assays
Another way of determining if a particular sequence of DNA is involved in
transcription factor binding is gel retardation or gel shift assays. Here, the
DNA fragment is mixed with nuclear proteins. If one or more of these bind
to the DNA fragment, its mobility in a polyacrylamide or agarose gel will be
decreased. This can be easily detected by comparing it with a control sample
without added protein (Figure 13.14). To investigate the specificity of the
reaction, we can add different amounts of protein to ensure that there is a
linear dose relationship.
Both footprinting and gel retardation assays are applicable to any protein
that binds to specific DNA sequences, and are not limited to those proteins that
regulate transcription of the DNA.

13.3.5 Run-on assays
Above, we have discussed several methods for determining the amount of an
mRNA species in a sample `frozen' in time (what is called, not always accurately, `steady-state levels'). These, as we have seen, have the disadvantage
of only showing us the net effect of promoter activation and mRNA degradation at one given moment. Using reporter gene assays, we are able to start
disentangling the actual effects of the promoter and of the other regulatory
elements, but they have the disadvantage of being `contaminated' by the fact
that the read-out is a different protein. All of these methods are very useful
within these limitations, but sometimes you want to obtain a more accurate
read-out. This is found in the run-on assay, also known as nuclear or transcriptional run-on assay (also, confusingly, called run-off assay!). This assay
quantifies the actual transcription of the specific gene in a sample. Nuclei are
harvested either from cultured cells or whole tissue and supplied with radiolabelled UTP. They are then left to proceed with transcription, for a
short period of time, of all active genes according to their degree of activation
in the situation when the nuclei were harvested. The radiolabelled mRNA
created by transcription of your gene of interest can then be specifically
quantified by immobilizing it through hybridization to `cold' complementary
DNA.

13.4 TRANSLATIONAL ANALYSIS

253

13.4 Translational Analysis
The methods for studying protein expression were developed earlier than DNA
cloning methods. For example, it was possible to sequence proteins (if they
could be purified in large enough amounts) before gene sequencing was developed. When gene cloning techniques became available, the characterization
of DNA and mRNA became much easier than sequencing their protein products. However, many protein biochemists are gleefully witnessing the renaissance of their craft, now renamed proteomics. Not least the realization that the
human genome contains many fewer genes than there are proteins has
reminded molecular biologists that gene products must be studied on both
levels (to say nothing of the actual effect on the cell or organism as a whole) in
order to understand how a gene works.

13.4.1 Western blots
The conventional way of analysing the proteins produced by a cell involves
electrophoresis through a polyacrylamide gel in the presence of sodium dodecyl
sulphate (SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, or SDS-PAGE). In general,
there are too many proteins present to give a clear picture of the complete
protein profile if you simply stain the gel with a general protein stain, although
much higher resolution can be obtained by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis
(see later in this chapter). In a one-dimensional SDS-PAGE, you will usually
only be able to see the major bands, and even then it is not always easy to
identify any specific protein.
The generally applicable technique for the detection of a specific protein, and
analysis of its expression, relies on the use of specific antibodies, in combination with SDS-PAGE. Following separation of the cell extract by SDSPAGE, the proteins are transferred to a membrane by running a perpendicular
current through the gel into the membrane, and a specific protein or proteins
detected using antibodies (see Chapter 8). These antibodies can be either
labelled themselves or, more commonly, detected by a second labelled antibody. For example if your primary antibody is a mouse antibody that recognizes the required protein, the binding of that antibody can be detected by a
labelled rabbit anti-mouse antibody. The analogy with a Southern blot led to
this technique being termed Western blotting. The technique will identify not
just the presence or absence of a protein that reacts with the antigen, but also its
size and an estimate of relative levels of expression. In Figure 13.15, we see that
expression was not detected in sample 2, and only weakly in sample 1, while the

protein detected in track 5 was a different size, perhaps due to post-translational modification; both bands were present in track 4.
The major considerations in the use of antibodies for molecular biology were
covered in Chapter 8 (see Box 8.2). The main point to remember is that proteins
in an SDS-PAGE gel are denatured, so the antibody must be capable of
recognizing a linear epitope. For recombinant proteins, you also require an
antibody that binds to a non-glycosylated epitope. The complex mixture of
antibodies in a conventional antiserum is virtually guaranteed to contain some
suitable antibodies, but an individual monoclonal antibody may fail one or
both criteria. On the other hand, monoclonal antibodies have the advantage of
reproducibility, whereas the antisera from different animals may differ in
sensitivity and specificity.

13.4.2 Immunocytochemistry and immunohistochemistry
This method (differently described depending on whether we are working with
cells or tissues) relates to Western blotting the way in situ hybridization relates
to Northern blotting. The blotting method allows us to determine whether the
probe (whether antibody or nucleic acid probe) is specific and, if it is, how
many polypeptides or transcripts it recognizes, and what size they are. The
cytological/histological method, by contrast, allows us to determine which cell
type the gene product is localized to. Apart from being much easier to perform
and less prone to artefacts than in situ hybridization, the study of the translated
protein product has an added bonus. The intracellular localization of an mRNA,
as determined by in situ hybridization, is rarely particularly revealing ±

255

13.4 TRANSLATIONAL ANALYSIS

a transcript lingers in the vicinity of the nucleus whilst being translated, and
that is that. However, the destination of the translated protein shows much
greater variation. Some are cytoplasmic, some are membrane-bound; some
gather at one pole of the cell (which, in a nerve cell, could be many centimetres
away from the nucleus), and others re-enter the nucleus. The localization of a
protein can give us important clues to its function, and indeed the incorrect
transport of a protein can give us important information about a disease
phenotype.

13.4.3 Two-dimensional electrophoresis
Western blotting is suitable for analysing the production of a single protein (if
you have a suitable antibody to it), but if you want to examine the overall
protein composition you need a different technique. This can be done by twodimensional gel electrophoresis, which involves isoelectric focussing (IEF) in
one direction and SDS-PAGE in the other (Figure 13.16). Isoelectric focussing
consists of applying an electric field across a stable pH gradient. All proteins
have a characteristic isoelectric point (or pI), that is a pH value at which they
have no net negative or positive charge. At pH values above the pI, the protein
will be negatively charged; below the pI the net charge will be positive. Negatively charged proteins will therefore move through the pH gradient towards
the positively charged electrode (anode) until they reach a pH equal to their pI,

at which point they are no longer charged ; similarly the positively charged
proteins will move towards the cathode until they reach their pI. The end result
is that each protein will focus at a characteristic point on the pH gradient. The
second dimension separates the proteins according to their size.
After 2D gel electrophoresis, you will get a pattern of spots that can be
compared with other patterns to enable the identification of proteins that are
present in one strain but not another, or proteins that are differentially expressed according to changes in environmental conditions or phase of growth.
It is necessary to exercise careful control of the conditions used to enable a
reliable comparison to be made. It should also be noted that a single protein
can occur at different positions in a 2D gel, for example as a consequence of
differences in post-translational modification.

13.4.4 Proteomics
Rather than focussing on a limited number of specific spots on a 2D gel, you
may want to determine the complete profile of proteins that are made by the
organism in question under defined conditions. The distinction is analogous to
the difference between studying individual genes and sequencing a whole
genome. The profile of expressed proteins is referred to as the proteome (by
analogy with the genome), and hence the study of the spectrum of proteins
produced is known as proteomics. It should be emphasized that while the
genome of an organism is a fixed entity (give or take a bit of variation), the
profile of expressed proteins will be different according to factors such as
growth conditions and cellular differentiation.
The most commonly used way of attempting to define the proteome is to try
to identify all the spots on a 2D protein gel. The best way of identifying and
characterizing a protein, whether it is purified by conventional means or it is a
spot on a 2D gel, is to determine its sequence. The technology for protein
sequencing has advanced very markedly, so that it is now possible using
microsequencing techniques to obtain protein sequences from individual
spots. However, this would be a rather cumbersome way of identifying all the
spots on a 2D protein gel. Fortunately, if the genome sequence is available, we
can use quicker methods.
For example, the protein can be eluted from the gel and digested with a
proteolytic enzyme that will cut the protein only at specific positions determined by the amino acid sequence. This will produce a set of peptides. The
precise molecular mass of each peptide in that mixture can readily be determined by mass spectrometry. From the genome sequence, we can predict the
sequence of all potential proteins, and from that information we can predict
the sizes of all the peptides that would be generated from each protein (since we
know the specificity of cleavage of the protease). The computer can then

13.4 TRANSLATIONAL ANALYSIS

257

compare the sizes of the peptides we have found with the peptides that would
be generated from each predicted protein ± and hence identify the protein.
Even this procedure is time-consuming, if you have to rely on recovering
each spot from the gel by hand. For large-scale proteomics, it is possible to use
automated equipment that will recognize spots on the gel, excise each one
individually, and carry out the mass spectrometry of the peptides. This gives
high-throughput identification of proteins and is capable of defining extensive
proteomes virtually completely.
If the genome sequence is not available, alternative forms of mass spectrometry are capable of identifying at least part of the amino acid sequence of the
protein. This information can then be used to predict the likely sequence of part
of the DNA of the corresponding gene, which enables you to design a nucleic
acid probe to recover that gene from a gene library (see Chapter 8).

14 Analysis of Gene Function
14.1 Relating Genes and Functions
We have already, in Chapter 11, discussed how we can use the primary DNA
sequence of a gene to make predictions about the structure and function of its
protein products. However, this approach has limitations. First, a substantial
portion of the genes identified in any genome sequence are not related to any
known gene. Second, in many cases where there is similarity to another gene,
that gene itself is of unknown function. Also, there is always the cautionary
note that bioinformatics can make predictions about function, but does not
provide definitive answers. This chapter deals with some of the methods that
can be used to identify or confirm the function of specific genes, which includes
an integration of molecular (in vitro) and classical (in vivo) genetic techniques.
The subsequent chapters also contain material relevant to this question. In
Chapter 15 we will look at the use of systems to express specifically modified
(or wholly synthetic) genes, while Chapter 16 includes the use of molecular
techniques to identify the gene changes responsible for human genetic diseases.
Finally, in Chapter 17 we will discuss how genes can be removed, inserted, or
modified in living multicellular organisms, including the use of these procedures in the analysis of gene function.

14.2 Genetic Maps
14.2.1 Linked and unlinked genes
The classical approach to genetics starts with the identification of variants
which have a specific phenotype, i.e. they are altered in some way that can be
seen (or detected in other ways) and defined. For Mendel, this was the appearance of his peas (e.g. green versus yellow, or round versus wrinkled). One of the
postulates he arrived at was that these characteristics assorted independently of
one another. For example, if you cross a strain that produces yellow round
peas with another strain that produces green wrinkled peas, the first generation

260

ANALYSIS OF GENE FUNCTION

(F1) are all round and yellow (because round is dominant over wrinkled, and
yellow is dominant over green). Let us assume that the original parents are
homozygous, i.e. they carry identical versions of both alleles; these are described
as GGWW and ggww respectively (where G  yellow, g  green; W  round,
w  wrinkled). The F1 generation, although they all appear round and yellow,
are actually heterozygous (GgWw). If you then cross the F1 peas with themselves, the next generation (F2) will contain yellow and green peas in a 3:1 ratio.
The ratio of round to wrinkled peas will also be 3:1, irrespective of whether the
peas are yellow or green. This is explained in more detail in Figure 14.1. In

GENETIC MAPS

other words, the green/yellow character is assorted independently of the round/
wrinkled property. We would described these characters (and the genes responsible) as unlinked.
Of course Mendel did not know why this happened. We now know that if
genes are located on different chromosomes, they will segregate independently
during meiosis, and will thus be distributed independently amongst the progeny. The same can happen if the two genes are on the same chromosome,
but are so far apart that the recombination between the homologous chromosomes will be sufficient to reassort them independently. On the other hand, if
they are quite close together, they will tend to remain associated during
meiosis, and will therefore be inherited together. We refer to genes that
do not segregate independently as linked; the closer they are, the greater the
degree of linkage, i.e. the more likely they are to stay together during meiosis.
Measuring the degree of linkage (linkage analysis) is a central tool in classical
genetics, in that it provides a way of mapping genes, i.e. determining their
relative position on the chromosome. Furthermore, it provides us with an
important method for correlating genetic and physical maps, as described
below.
Bacteria and yeasts provide much more convenient systems for genetic
analysis, because they grow quickly, as unicellular organisms, and on defined
media. You can therefore use chemical or physical mutagens (such as UV
irradiation) to produce a wide range of mutations, and can select specific
mutations from very large pools of organisms ± remembering that an overnight
culture of E. coli will contain some 109 bacteria per ml. These mutations may
simply affect the ability to produce a specific amino acid, manifested as a
requirement for that amino acid to be added to the growth medium, or to
use a particular carbon source such as lactose. Alternatively, it may be a more
complex phenotype, such as loss of motility, or inability to divide into two cells
leading to production of filaments. So we can use genetic techniques to investigate detailed aspects of the physiology of such cells, including identifying the
relevant genes by mapping the position of the mutations. Although the techniques in bacteria differ from those in higher organisms, forms of linkage
analysis still play a major role.
For multicellular organisms, the range of phenotypes is even greater, as we
now have questions concerning the development of different parts of the
organism. However, animals have much longer generation times than bacteria
and, depending on the species, using millions of animals to identify the mutations you are interested in is either cumbersome, impossible, or indefensible.
Human genetics is even more difficult as you cannot use selected breeding to
map genes; you have to rely on the analysis of real families. Nevertheless,
classical genetics has contributed extensively to the study of developmental
processes, notably in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, where it is possible
to study quite large numbers (although nothing like the numbers that can be

262

ANALYSIS OF GENE FUNCTION

used in bacterial genetics), and to use mutagenic agents to enhance the rate of
variation.

14.3 Relating Genetic and Physical Maps
In any of these systems, the question addressed by classical genetics is the same:
can we locate the gene that is associated with a specific phenotype? This
produces a genetic map, in which the position of these genes on the chromosome is determined, relative to other genes. However, the genetic map does not
directly tell us what these genes actually do.
On the other hand, as we have seen in previous chapters, molecular techniques are, in the first place, concerned with the structure of genes and their
sequence. This could start with cloning and sequencing a fragment of DNA;
you could then use hybridization techniques to find the position of that
sequence on the chromosome, producing a physical map of the chromosome.
Physical maps can take other forms as well, including maps of restriction sites.
Ultimately, you can determine the complete sequence of the genome, which is
the ultimate physical map. It tells you exactly the DNA sequence at any
position on the genome but, taken in isolation, tells you nothing about the
nature or function of the genes or their products. In order to advance our
understanding further, we have to be able to relate the genetic and physical
maps.
To some extent we can tackle the problem from either end. For example, we
could start with the classical approach, i.e. isolating specific variants and
mapping the genes concerned. We would then follow that with the techniques
described in the previous chapter to isolate and clone the DNA region that is
different in the mutant and wild-type organisms ± in this way linking the
genetic map to the structure of a specific gene. Later in this chapter we describe
techniques that are specifically designed for this purpose.
Alternatively, we can start from the other end. If we know the sequence of a
piece of DNA, or the entire genome, we can (as described in Chapter 11) infer
the likely nature of the enzyme or other product coded for by each gene, by
comparison with the sequence of known genes from other organisms. So we
can work backwards from the physical map towards the genetic one. However,
this approach has limitations. First, a substantial proportion of the predicted
genes identified in any genome sequence are either not related to any known
gene, or are related to another gene of unknown function. Second, even where
there is a good degree of similarity with another gene that is labelled as coding
for an identified enzyme, that identification is only as good as the identification
of the gene we are comparing it with. As discussed in Chapter 11, there is a risk
of setting up a chain of increasingly unreliable similarities. Furthermore, we
cannot be sure in all cases that enzymes with a similar structure actually carry

14.4

LINKAGE ANALYSIS

263

out the same biochemical reaction. The enzyme beta-lactamase, responsible for
ampicillin resistance (as used in many cloning vectors) is similar in some
respects to a serine protease, but it is not a proteolytic enzyme.
There is a final limitation to this approach that is more fundamental in
nature. We may have correctly identified the biochemical reaction carried out
by the enzyme for which our gene is responsible. However, this does not
necessarily tell us what role that gene plays in the characteristics of the cell.
For bacteria, and other unicellular organisms, it may be relatively straightforward to understand the role of enzymes that are components of a simple
metabolic pathway, such as synthesis of an amino acid ± but, even at this
simplest of levels, such understanding is not always completely straightforward. The organism may have more than one gene coding for enzymes that
carry out the same reaction, so we would have to ask under what conditions
each of those genes is used. With more subtle processes, it may be very difficult
to ascertain the role of specific proteins ± and if we consider complex processes
such as the regulation of cell division it is likely to be impossible to determine
the role of individual proteins just by examining their structure. If we then
move on to consider a multicellular organism such as an animal, there is an
even bigger jump from knowing the biochemical function of the enzyme to
understanding its role in the whole animal.
We can now look at some of the techniques that are available for constructing more direct links between genetic and physical maps, i.e. for
establishing (or confirming) more directly the actual function in the cell of
specific genes.

14.4 Linkage Analysis
For the first of these techniques, we can return to the topic of linkage analysis.
As described earlier in this chapter, this is a classic technique for establishing
how close two genes are on the chromosome. So if our genetic mapping data
tell us that the gene we are interested in is closely linked to another marker that
has been characterized, we can narrow down the search for the gene of interest
to a much smaller region of the chromosome. However, this would require the
mapping of a very large number of genes if we are to be sure that there will be a
mapped gene very close to our unknown gene. The distances separating known
linked genetic markers in mammals commonly run to thousands of kilobases
(1 per cent recombination corresponds to about 1000 kb, or 1 Mb, of DNA).
However, the second marker does not have to be a functional gene; it can be a
polymorphic marker such as the microsatellites described in Chapter 12. If
the unknown gene is often co-inherited with such a polymorphism, linkage
analysis can identify its position to a comparatively short region, which
can then be cloned and characterized to identify the nature of the mutation

264

ANALYSIS OF GENE FUNCTION

that is responsible for the observed variation. This technique, known as
positional cloning, has been used for the identification of important human
genes such as BRCA1 the presence of which predisposes to breast cancer. The
identification of genes associated with human diseases is covered further in
Chapter 16.

14.4.1 Ordered libraries and chromosome walking
In Chapter 7, we described the construction of a special type of gene library
known as an ordered library, which consists of a set of overlapping clones so
that the position of each clone is known with respect to the clones on either side
on the genome. This provides, in essence, a form of physical map of the genome
(and ordered libraries have played a significant role in some of the genome
sequencing projects). Any gene that has been cloned can easily be located to
one of these clones by hybridization. (Of course if the genome sequence is
known this is not necessary.) We can then use that as a starting point for
locating other genes that are known to be linked to the first marker.
Construction of ordered libraries, especially of large genomes, is a laborious
undertaking. A more generally applicable version of the technique is that
known as chromosome walking (see Figure 14.2). Again, this requires as a
starting point a marker that is known to be linked to the gene in question.
This marker is used to identify a clone from a gene library, by hybridization.
That clone is then used to screen the gene library in order to identify overlapping clones; one (or more) of these clones is then in turn used as a probe to
identify other clones that overlap with it. These steps are repeated until the
required sequence is reached.

TRANSPOSON MUTAGENESIS

265

14.5 Transposon Mutagenesis
Although these methods can be applied to bacteria, the smaller genome and the
availability of additional tools makes it unnecessary.
Once again, the starting point is a mutant with an interesting phenotype, and
we want to identify the gene that has been altered. If the change is a major one,
such as deletion, this is straightforward; we can use array technology (Chapter
12) to identify the region of the chromosome that has been deleted, by the
absence of hybridization to a specific DNA fragment on the array. If the
mutation results in the failure of expression of the gene concerned, we can use
differential or subtractive hybridization, as described in Chapter 13. However,
many of our mutants are likely to be point mutations, i.e. alterations of a single
nucleotide, which result in production of an inactive protein. Such mutations
would not be detected by those techniques. An alternative is to carry out the
mutation with a procedure that would at the same time label the affected portion
of the DNA sequence. This can be done using transposon mutagenesis.
Transposons are DNA sequences that have the ability to move from one
DNA site to another. Part of the DNA of a transposon codes for an enzyme
(transposase) that is capable of carrying out a special form of recombination,
involving inverted repeat sequences at each end of the transposon, that results
in insertion of the transposon at a new position, either on the same DNA
molecule or on a different one. Transposons can thus move from one site to
another on the chromosome, or they can move from a plasmid to the chromosome, or from one plasmid to another. The details of the process can vary quite
considerably from one transposon to another, but that does not need to
concern us. We should, however, note two features: some transposons, but
not all of them, replicate in the process (i.e. one copy stays at the original site
and a new copy is inserted elsewhere), and some transposons can insert more or
less at random while others have varying degrees of specificity. One of the most
commonly used transposons is Tn5 (or derivatives thereof), which is not very
specific in its insertion site requirements, and hence can insert at a large number
of positions.
A further feature of transposons that is relevant here is that they generally
carry antibiotic resistance genes. Indeed they play, together with plasmids, a
major role in the spread of antibiotic resistance genes amongst pathogenic
bacteria. However, transposition not only moves genes between different
sites; insertion of a transposon within a coding sequence will usually inactivate
that gene, thus producing a mutation. The site of that mutation is now marked
by the presence of the resistance gene, which makes it relatively easy to clone,
and thus to identify, the affected portion of the DNA.
The procedure in practice (illustrated in Figure 14.3) is to use a plasmid,
carrying the transposon, which is unable to replicate in the host species being

investigated; this is known as a suicide plasmid. Even better is to use a plasmid
that is temperature-sensitive for replication, so you can establish the plasmid at
a low temperature (e.g. 308C, the permissive temperature) and subsequently
prevent its replication by shifting the incubation temperature to say 428C (the
restrictive temperature). Inside the bacterial cells, the plasmid is unable to
replicate at the restrictive temperature. Thus, if we plate the transformed
bacteria on a medium containing the relevant antibiotic, only those cells in
which the transposon has hopped onto the chromosome will be able to survive
and grow to form colonies. If this happens, the transposon will be replicated as
part of the bacterial chromosome.
Of course we do not know where the transposon will have jumped to, but
there are a large number of possibilities. We can store this collection of cells as
a transposon mutagenesis library. Within this library we hope there will be some
bacteria in which the transposon has ended up within the gene(s) we are
interested in.

14.5

TRANSPOSON MUTAGENESIS

267

The procedure now requires a method of testing for the mutation that we are
interested in. In some cases this is relatively easy. We can identify auxotrophs
(mutants that require a specific supplement, such as an amino acid, in the
growth medium) for example, by replica plating. With other types of mutants,
we may have to employ more ingenuity in screening our library to identify the
mutants that we need.
Assuming we can identify a number of mutants that may be of interest, the
next step is straightforward. We can extract genomic DNA from those cells,
digest it with a restriction enzyme, and ligate these fragments with a suitable
vector. In effect, we create a genomic library, but we do not need the complete
library; we are only interested in those fragments that carry the transposon. We
can identify these quite easily because they will contain the antibiotic resistance
gene that is part of the transposon. So we just need to plate the library onto
agar containing the relevant antibiotic, and only those clones that carry the
transposon will be able to grow.
These clones will contain not only the transposon but also a portion of the
DNA either side of the insertion side. Determining the sequence of this
flanking DNA will therefore enable us to identify the gene into which the
transposon has inserted, and we thus have a direct link between the sequence
and the phenotype, i.e. we know (subject to certain limitations that are discussed below) that inactivation of that gene gives rise to that phenotype, and
hence we can infer the function of that gene in the normal life of the cell.
As is so often the case, PCR provides us with an alternative to cloning for
this purpose. We cannot do a straightforward PCR, because that would require
knowledge of the flanking sequence, for designing the primers, and that is
exactly what we do not know. One strategy that we can adopt in such circumstance is known as inverse PCR (see Figure 14.4). If we cut the DNA with a
restriction enzyme (using one that does not cut the transposon itself), then,
instead of ligating these fragments with a vector, we can carry out a ligation in
the absence of a vector and under conditions that promote self-ligation (intramolecular rather than intermolecular ligation). Reference to Chapter 5 will
show this requires ligation at low DNA concentrations, whereas usually we do
ligation at high concentrations of DNA to promote ligation of DNA fragments
with the vector DNA. The consequence of self-ligation is that, amongst a lot of
other fragments, we have circular molecules containing the transposon and the
flanking sequences. Although this will be only one amongst thousands of
products, the flanking sequences can be amplified by PCR, using primers
derived from the known sequence of the transposon and directed outwards
from the transposon.
In transgenic multicellular organisms (Chapter 17), similar situations are
sometimes encountered when an introduced transgene happens to lodge itself
inside another gene. Because only a small fraction of eukaryotic genomes

actually code for gene products, this is a much less likely occurrence than in
bacteria. However, although useless from the point of view of the intended
experiment, these strains are sometimes useful for gene mapping and/or as
disease models.
In addition to using transposons for mutagenesis of host genes, we can also
use transposon mutagenesis to obtain a library of mutations in a cloned gene,
since transposition can occur between plasmids, as well as into the chromosome. In Chapter 15 we discuss ways in which specific alterations can be made
in a cloned gene. However, if we want to study the functions of different parts
of the gene, it can be useful to introduce random mutations within the gene.
Transposon mutagenesis enables us to do this quickly and easily.

14.5.1 Transposition in Drosophila
The discussion of transposons and transposition has so far focussed on bacteria. However, transposable elements of one sort or another are common in
all types of organisms. The family of transposable elements known as P
elements, which occur in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, are especially
important ± both in providing vectors for the integration of foreign genes into
the Drosophila genome and in providing a system for transposon mutagenesis
of Drosophila.

14.5

TRANSPOSON MUTAGENESIS

269

Transposition of P elements, as with bacterial transposons, requires the
action of a transposase, acting on inverted repeat sequences at the ends of
the element. In a P strain, which carries multiple copies of the P element
dispersed throughout the genome, the transposase is repressed and so no
further transposition occurs. However, if sperm from a P strain fertilizes an
egg from a strain that does not contain a P element, the temporary absence of
the repressor causes extensive transposition, resulting in a high rate of mutation.
The P element is also able to transpose into the genome from an injected
piece of DNA. Therefore, if we insert a piece of foreign DNA into a P element
contained on a plasmid vector, and then inject that construct into a fruit fly
embryo, the P element will transpose into the genome, carrying our inserted
DNA fragment with it. However, it is not easy to insert DNA into a P element
without disrupting the transposase gene. Figure 14.5 shows how we can get
round this problem. The transposase can act in trans, i.e. it can be expressed
from a different piece of DNA. In the example shown, the foreign DNA
fragment has replaced most of the P element genes, leaving the inverted repeat
ends intact. The transposase is expressed from a second copy of the P element,
and it will recognize the inverted repeats flanking the foreign DNA, resulting in
transposition of the insert into the chromosome (with the IR ends). At the same
time, we do not want the element with the intact transposase to be inserted as
well, as it would cause additional mutations. So we remove the inverted repeat
ends from the P element that has the transposase, rendering it non-mobile; this
is referred to as a `wings-clipped' element.
The main applications of this approach lie not in the expression of genes
from other organisms in Drosophila, but in identifying or confirming the
relationship between specific genes and identified phenotypes. As a simple

example, RosyÀ flies have brown eyes rather than red ones. Insertion of a DNA
fragment coding for the enzyme xanthine dehydrogenase will restore the wildtype eye colour, thus confirming the function of the rosy gene; this is an
example of complementation (see later in this chapter). Fruit flies have been
used extensively as a model system, especially for research into differentiation
and development of multicellular organisms, and the ability to link phenotypes
with specific DNA sequences in this way has been an important component of
these advances.
The applications of P elements do not end there. Insertion of a P element into
the chromosome can cause a mutation, and since the affected gene is tagged
with the transposon, it is readily identified, as in bacterial transposon mutagenesis described above. Another application involves a P element containing a
reporter gene (such as the beta-galactosidase gene, lacZ) with a weak promoter. Random insertion of this element into the genome will occasionally
result in integration adjacent to an enhancer element, resulting in activation of
expression of the reporter gene. This technique, known as enhancer trapping,
enables the identification of enhancers and their specific activity in certain cell
types; related ways of using reporters to identify regulatory sequences, such as
bacterial promoter-probe vectors, were described in Chapter 13.
These applications to fruit flies represent an example of transgenics, in that
they include the manipulation not just of individual cells but of the whole
organism. Further examples of transgenics, as applied to higher animals and
plants, are discussed in Chapter 17.

14.5.2 Other applications of transposons
The description above of the use of P elements in Drosophila exemplifies how
we can use the ability of transposons to insert more or less randomly within the
chromosome in a variety of ways. In a bacterial system, as in Drosophila, we
can use a transposon incorporating a reporter gene to identify genes that are
expressed under a specific set of conditions. We can expose the transposon
library to the environmental conditions in question, such as anaerobic growth,
and identify those clones that show expression of the reporter gene. Alternatively, if we include an alkaline phosphatase gene as a reporter (Tnpho transposon) we can identify secreted proteins. This depends on the fact that alkaline
phosphatase activity is only exhibited if the enzyme is secreted, and not if it
remains in the cytoplasm. Insertion of Tnpho within a gene coding for a
secreted protein can give rise to a fusion protein carrying the secretion signals
from the native protein joined to the alkaline phosphatase. If this product is
secreted, then phosphatase activity will be detected.
A form of transposon mutagenesis can also be used to identify genes that are
necessary for the virulence of pathogenic bacteria. Insertion of the transposon

14.5

TRANSPOSON MUTAGENESIS

271

into such a gene will attenuate the organism, i.e. it will destroy (or reduce) its
virulence. This will be manifested by a reduced ability to grow or survive
following administration to an experimental animal, or in some cases by a
reduction in its ability to survive attack by macrophages in culture. It is not
possible to select directly such a mutation, and testing the thousands of
mutants in a transposon library is impractical.
However, we can modify the transposon by incorporating a highly variable
sequence tag so that each copy of the transposon is uniquely identifiable
(Figure 14.6). We then produce a transposon mutant library, with these tagged
transposons, and infect mice with a pool of transposon mutants. Those clones
in which the transposon has inserted into a gene that is essential for virulence
will be unable to replicate in the mice and will therefore be absent when we
recover the bacteria from the infected mice. We then use PCR to amplify all the
tags that are present in the recovered bacteria, and label the collection of PCR
products for use as a probe. Identification of the tags that are absent in this
mixture is carried out by probing a membrane that contains a gridded array of
each of the clones from the original transposon mutant library. Absence of

hybridization means that the clone concerned was not present in the material
recovered from the mice ± and hence identifies this as a mutant in which
an essential virulence gene has been inactivated by the transposon. The gene
can then be recovered and identified as described above. This technique,
known as signature tagged mutagenesis, has proved to be an extremely powerful tool for the identification of virulence genes ± or, in principle, for the
identification of any gene that is essential for the growth of the bacteria
under defined conditions.
Transposons can also be used to facilitate the sequencing of a large insert.
You can normally only obtain half a kb or so of high-quality sequence in each
run. As discussed in Chapter 10, there are different ways around this problem.
The most straightforward one is to make new, customized primers for walking
down the gene. A recently developed method uses a donor vector that leaves a
universal primer sequence embedded in a transposon, which will allow you to
create easily a library of clones that can be sequenced for the rapid assembly of
the full sequence of the insert.

14.6 Allelic Replacement and Gene Knock-outs
Transposon mutagenesis provides a useful method for identifying unknown
genes that are connected with a selectable (or at least readily identifiable)
phenotype. What of the reverse situation? That is, when we have a gene, and
we know its sequence, but we do not know what its function is. One of the most
powerful strategies in such a situation is known variously as allelic replacement
or gene replacement or gene knock-out. This relies on the natural process of
homologous recombination, which means that when there are two identical
pieces of DNA in the cell, enzymes within the cell may break the two DNA
chains, cross them over and rejoin them. (This is a highly simplistic version of a
more complex process, but it will do for our purposes.) We can exploit this
process to replace a specific gene (or part of a gene) in the chromosome with a
version that we have inactivated in vitro, thus destroying the function of that
gene. This allows us to test the consequences of inactivating an individual gene,
and thus make deductions about its function.
A typical procedure for allelic replacement in a bacterial host would be to
manipulate the cloned gene so as to replace the central part of the gene with an
antibiotic resistance gene (see Figure 14.7). We would do this using a suicide
plasmid (as described above, for transposon mutagenesis) so that when we
transform the bacteria with the construct, only those cells in which the resistance gene has become incorporated into the chromosome will become antibiotic resistant. We can select these on agar containing the antibiotic. If things go
well, incorporation into the chromosome will have occurred by homologous
recombination at the required position, thus inactivating the gene concerned.

It should be noted that replacement of the gene actually requires recombination at two positions, one either side of the gene. This is referred to as a double
cross-over event. A single cross-over, in the homologous region at one side or
the other of the construct, will produce resistant bacteria by incorporation of
the entire plasmid into the chromosome rather than replacing the gene. Single
cross-overs may result in gene inactivation, depending on the details of the
construct, but will usually be unstable, as further recombination may eliminate
the plasmid again, restoring the original intact gene. We can select against
single cross-overs by incorporating a counter-selectable marker into the plasmid. In other words, we put a gene on the plasmid that will, if it is still present,
confer a disadvantage on the cell. A gene known as sacB is commonly used for
this purpose, as the presence of sacB renders the cells sensitive to sucrose in the
medium. Plating the cells on a sucrose containing medium will result in any
cells containing sacB (which includes the single cross-overs but not the doubles)
being unable to grow and form colonies.
An obvious limitation of gene replacement technology is that the inactivation of the gene concerned may be a lethal event. Nevertheless, it is a valuable
approach for identifying the function of specific genes.
Although we have described gene replacement in terms of identifying gene
function, its applications extend far beyond that. It can be used to inactivate
genes that are necessary for the virulence of a pathogenic bacterium, thus
producing attenuated strains that may be useful vaccine candidates. In addition, essentially identical procedures can be used to knock out genes in other

274

ANALYSIS OF GENE FUNCTION

organisms, including experimental animals (especially mice). Many strains of
mice, lacking individual genes, have been produced in this way, and are
invaluable for research purposes. This is considered further in Chapter 17.
It should be noted also that the technique is not confined to the inactivation
of the genes concerned. The technique can be readily adapted to the replacement of a gene by an altered version of the same gene, thus conferring novel
properties on the organism.

14.7 Complementation
In the discussion of both transposon mutagenesis and allelic replacement, it has
been implicitly assumed that the phenotypic consequences of the mutation are
due solely to the effect of the loss of that gene. This is not always true. In
particular, some mutations (especially those caused by insertion of a transposon) may show an effect known as polarity. This means that the mutation
affects not only the altered gene, but also those adjacent to it. In bacteria, this
can arise from the arrangement of genes into operons which are transcribed
into a single mRNA. Mutation of one gene may interfere with transcription of
the operon, and thus affect the expression of the genes downstream from it.
Furthermore, genes and their products interact in many complex ways within
the cell, so that disruption of one gene may have unexpected effects on the
activity of other genes and their products.
It is therefore necessary to interpret carefully the results arising from these
experiments. The standard way of checking that the altered phenotype is a
direct consequence of the inactivation of a specific gene is by complementation.
This involves introducing into the mutant cell a fully active version of the
affected gene (usually a cloned version on a plasmid). If the alteration in the
phenotype is indeed due solely to the loss of the affected gene and its product,
then the mutation will be complemented by the plasmid, i.e. the wild-type
phenotype will be restored. This is not entirely foolproof. For example, if the
original mutation disrupts the regulation of other genes, complementation may
be successful in restoring the wild-type phenotype, even though the gene
product is not directly responsible for the observed characteristics. Nevertheless, complementation does provide an element of confirmation of the consequences of the original mutation.

14.8 Studying Gene Function through Protein
Interactions
Genes do not, of course, `function' at the DNA level. Some genes function
solely by producing specific RNA molecules (such as rRNA, tRNA). Most,

14.8 STUDYING GENE FUNCTION THROUGH PROTEIN INTERACTIONS

275

however, exert their function by the production of protein. Thus, to a large
extent, studying gene function means studying protein function. Most of the
methods for this fall outside the scope of this book. However, we will cover two
methods which are frequently used both to identify genes and to characterize
their function.

14.8.1 Two-hybrid screening
One important clue as to the function of a protein is its ability to interact with
other proteins. Two-hybrid screening is a commonly used method to identify
such interactions; since this method is normally used with yeast cells as a host
organism, it is therefore often called yeast two-hybrid screening (although
versions are now available for bacterial and mammalian cells as well).
The basis of this procedure is similar to yeast one-hybrid screening, as
described in Chapter 13, in that it depends on the modular nature of transcriptional activators such as GAL4; the activator domain (AD) does not have to be
covalently attached to the DNA-binding domain (BD). Provided the activator
domain can interact with a protein that is bound to DNA adjacent to a reporter
gene, transcriptional activation will occur.
The basis of the technique is illustrated in Figure 14.8. As implied by the
name, two recombinant plasmids have to be constructed. The first is made so
that one of the proteins that we wish to study (the bait) is expressed as a fusion
protein with a specific DNA-binding domain, while the second plasmid
expresses another protein (the prey) as a fusion with an activator domain.
The host is an engineered yeast strain that contains, inserted into the genome,

ANALYSIS OF GENE FUNCTION

a reporter gene with a specific operator or upstream activator sequence to
which the BD domain will bind. Expression of the reporter gene will only occur
if the two fusion proteins interact.
The system can be set up to test the interaction between the products of two
specific cloned genes. Alternatively, using a library of DNA fragments in the
prey vector, it is possible to identify those proteins that are able to interact with
a specific bait.
Although yeast two-hybrid assays originally employed GAL4 AD and BD
domains, it is apparent from the description that, since there is no direct
physical interaction between them, either or both can be replaced by domains
from other proteins. Indeed there are advantages in using heterologous proteins, that is proteins that are not derived from yeast. For example, in some
systems the BD domain is derived from the bacterial LexA protein, with the
LexA operator attached to the reporter gene.

14.8.2 Phage display libraries
In this method, DNA fragments are inserted into a cloning site within the gene
coding for one of the proteins that make up the surface of a filamentous phage
such as M13 (see Chapter 6). The fused gene gives rise to a hybrid protein
which (we hope) will be incorporated into the phage particle in such a way as to
display the foreign protein or peptide on the surface of the bacteriophage
particles that result from infection of host bacteria. (Figure 14.9). A phage
display library can be created either by cloning DNA fragments that code for
actual proteins or parts thereof, or by inserting synthetic oligonucleotides

designed to give rise to a representative collection of random peptides. The
phage particles displaying proteins or peptides with the required properties can
be recovered by adsorption to a tube or a well in a microtitre tray coated with
the appropriate ligand, such as an antibody, a hormone receptor, or another
protein. The non-specific phage are then washed off and the retained phage,
enriched for the specific recombinant, are then eluted; further rounds of
enrichment can be carried out. The power of this technique lies in the ability
to test very large numbers of phage particles ± M13 preparations can contain
1012 phage particles per ml ± and to carry out repeated rounds of enrichment
for the phage displaying proteins or peptide with the properties that you want.
Compare this with screening a gene library by hybridization or by antibody
screening.
Phage display libraries therefore can be used to screen very efficiently for
specific proteins or peptides, normally smaller molecules with pharmacological, enzymic, or antigenic properties. Identification of a peptide sequence
that binds to the ligand can be of direct use either in itself (such as in the search
for a therapeutic agent), or can serve to provide clues about the partial
sequence of a longer ligand-binding protein.

15 Manipulating
Gene
Expression
We use proteins, or smaller polypeptides, in many ways ± ranging from enzymes
that can be added to washing powders to hormones that are used for treating
medical conditions. Some of these proteins can be extracted easily, although at
some cost, from starting material that is readily available, e.g. plant material, or
microbial cultures. However, the potential source of such proteins is often
scarce or difficult to obtain which severely limits the application of this approach ± or may even make it impossible. This applies especially to proteins and
polypeptides from human sources, which can be invaluable for treating specific
diseases. The classic example here is of human growth hormone (somatotropin),
which is used for treating a condition known as pituitary dwarfism, where a
child's growth is affected by a deficiency in the production of this hormone by
the pituitary gland. For a long time, the only source of this hormone was from
pituitary glands removed from the bodies of people who had died from a variety
of other causes. The limitations on supply can be imagined; the safety implications, in terms of the potential transmission of disease by this route, were only
partly appreciated at the time. Other consequences were only realized more
recently when it was discovered that spongiform encephalopathies (CJD) could
be transmitted by this material.
Many bacteria and other microorganisms (especially yeasts) can be grown
easily and cheaply in essentially unlimited quantity. The expression of the gene
coding for the required protein in a microbial host can therefore enable us to
obtain that product in large amounts ± especially as we can manipulate the
gene to maximize its expression. Making a therapeutic product in this way also
removes the possibility of transmitting infectious agents, so it is much safer
than the `natural' product. It should also be emphasized that (subject to any
post-translational modifications which will be discussed later in this chapter)
the purified product obtained from recombinant bacteria is exactly the same as
the pure product from its original source. The only way in which the product
differs is that it is likely to be purer and will be free from infectious agents. (You
may have heard of some difficulties with the use of recombinant human insulin,

280

MANIPULATING GENE EXPRESSION

but these are largely a consequence of the greater purity of the product, rather
than an inherent problem of the recombinant product.)
The realization that the new genetic technologies would provide a way of
making products that had hitherto been expensive or impossible to produce
was a major driving force behind the commercial side of the biotechnology
revolution. The research implications are even more dramatic. Some proteins,
especially those responsible for regulating cellular activities and for communication between cells, are produced in tiny amounts. You may only be able to
detect their presence by extremely sensitive assay methods. It is likely to be
effectively impossible to extract and purify such a protein in sufficient quantity
to be able to characterize its structure or to analyse the way it works. Yet in
principle, as long as you can identify and clone the gene responsible, it will be
possible to express that gene in a microbial host and obtain substantial quantities of the product.

15.1 Factors Affecting Expression of Cloned
Genes
Expressing a foreign gene in a bacterial cell is not entirely straightforward. The
expression signals that control transcription and translation can be quite different from one organism to another, especially if you are moving a gene from a
eukaryotic source into a bacterial host. Expression can also be affected by the
base composition of the gene, and by the codon usage. These factors were covered
in Chapter 2, but are summarized here for ease of reference (see Figure 15.1). We
are generally assuming to start with that the host organism is a bacterium; the
expression of foreign genes in eukaryotic cells is considered later on.
(i ) Transcription. The main factor is the promoter site, i.e. the region where
the RNA polymerase binds to initiate RNA synthesis (Figure 15.2). This is
the principal step where bacteria control which DNA regions are to be
expressed and how strong that expression should be. The structure of the
RNA polymerase (and especially of the sigma factors that determine
the specificity) and the sequences of the promoter regions have evolved together to produce this carefully regulated expression. It is therefore not surprising that a gene from one species may not be expressed when inserted into a
different host.
Transcription signals in eukaryotes are generally substantially different from
bacterial promoters, but that is usually irrelevant. For gene expression you will
usually require cDNA rather than genomic DNA (to remove introns), so the
region upstream of the transcription start point will not be included in the
cloned fragment. You have to provide a promoter, using an expression vector.
This concept was introduced in Chapter 6 and is considered again later in this
chapter.

Transcription can also be affected by the base composition of the DNA. If the
cloned DNA comes from an organism with a higher GC content than that in
the new host, the stronger association of the two strands may hinder transcription, which requires local strand separation and unwinding of the helix.
It should also be borne in mind that in principle it is the amount of mRNA
available for translation that is important rather than the rate with which it
is produced, and that the level of a specific mRNA is determined by its stability
as well as by its rate of synthesis. However, in bacteria, the mRNA is typically
very short-lived (with a half-life measured in minutes), and translation normally
starts as soon as a ribosome-binding site (see below) is available. Differences in
stability between mRNAs are therefore less important in bacteria than in eukaryotes. Furthermore, it is easier to manipulate the level of transcription than to
alter the stability of a message, so we would generally focus on the former.
(ii ) Translation initiation. In bacteria, ribosomes normally bind to a region of
the mRNA adjacent to the start codon, facilitated by a sequence (the Shine±
Dalgarno sequence) that is (partially) complementary to the 3H end of the 16S
rRNA (Figure 15.2). This structure is reasonably well conserved in bacteria, so
you could expect to get some degree of translation initiation if you move a gene
from one bacterium to another (assuming transcription occurs). However, the
structure may not be optimal; even within the same organism, genes may not
have an optimum ribosome binding site, for example the distance between the

Shine±Dalgarno sequence and the start codon can vary, which can affect the
efficacy of translation initiation. So you may not get maximum gene expression
unless you manipulate this region.
Ribosome binding in eukaryotes works in a different way. Thus, if you
choose a bacterial host for expression of eukaryotic genes, you will usually
have to provide translational signals as well as a promoter.
The nature of the start codon may also have to be considered. In the
standard genetic code, AUG is used to signal the start of translation. However,
in some organisms (especially those with a high GC content), a proportion of
genes (sometimes the majority) use alternative start codons such as GUG,
UUG or CUG. Trying to express such a gene in an organism with a stricter
preference for an AUG start may limit or prevent translation, or give a product
with a different N-terminus.
(iii ) Codon usage. In the standard genetic code there are many sets of
synonymous codons, i.e. several codons that code for the same amino acid.
For example, any one of six different codons in the mRNA will result in
incorporation of leucine into the polypeptide (see Chapter 8, Box 8.1). These
different codons are not completely equivalent. The cell will use some codons
more readily than others, depending on the availability and specificity of tRNA
molecules that recognize these codons. Any occurrence of the less readily used
codons will slow down translation. The sequence of the genes in that organism

15.1

FACTORS AFFECTING EXPRESSION OF CLONED GENES

283

will therefore have evolved to match the availability of tRNAs, and some
synonymous codons will occur more frequently than their synonyms ± which
we refer to as codon bias. In a different organism, the tRNA population is
different, and the codon usage will also be different.
In nature, codon bias is much more pronounced for highly expressed genes,
such as those coding for enzymes of the central metabolic pathways. There is
more evolutionary pressure favouring the optimization of codon usage of such
genes than there is for genes coding for proteins that are produced at a lower
level. This is reflected in the behaviour of cloned genes. If we take a gene from
one organism and try to express it in another, with different codon usage, we
will probably get some expression (assuming everything else is working) but the
extent of that expression is likely to be limited. Expression may be enhanced by
altering the sequence of the gene to improve the codon usage for that host.
In extreme cases, you may actually fail to get expression at all. The host
organism may be virtually unable to recognize certain codons in your cloned
gene (and these would be absent from natural genes in that host); in effect,
these are acting as additional stop codons, and will cause premature termination of protein synthesis. This does not happen in E. coli, which is capable of
recognizing (to varying extents) all the codons in the standard code. However,
some other hosts have a more pronounced bias in their codon usage, with some
codons occurring extremely rarely.
The converse can occur too. In some organisms, a codon that is a stop signal
in the standard code is actually used by that organism to code for a specific
amino acid. For example, in some species UGA codes for tryptophan rather
than being a stop codon. If you try to express such a gene in E. coli, you are
likely to get premature termination at the UGA codon. It is possible to
overcome this by using E. coli host strains that have been engineered to
produce additional types of tRNA.
(iv ) GC content. Organisms vary very substantially in the base composition
of their DNA (ranging, approximately, from 30 per cent GC to 70 per cent
GC). So the composition of the cloned gene may be substantially different
from that of the new host. We have alluded to the possible effect this might
have on transcription; it is also likely to be reflected in differences in codon
usage. There is a wide range of other effects which could occur, which might
affect not only the expression of the gene but also other properties of the
recombinant. These include the structure and stability of the mRNA, supercoiling of DNA, and replication and stability of the recombinant vector itself.
(v ) Nature of the protein product. We also have to remember that the nature
of the protein product may influence the amount of protein that is recovered.
Most obviously (as with mRNA) the stability of the protein can have a major
effect: an inherently unstable protein will not be recovered in high yield, even if
we have maximized the rate of production. Amongst other factors, the location
of the product can have an important influence of the levels obtained. If the

284

MANIPULATING GENE EXPRESSION

protein remains in the cytoplasm, it may become insoluble at high rates of
synthesis, leading to the production of inclusion bodies, or aggregates of insoluble product. It can be difficult to recover active soluble protein from such
inclusion bodies. If the protein becomes inserted into the cytoplasmic membrane, it is likely to have a deleterious effect on the functions of the membrane;
expression of such proteins may be lethal, even at quite low levels.
For high levels of protein production, it is often advantageous to express the
product in a form that can be secreted into the culture medium, e.g. by attaching
signal sequences. Since the volume of the supernatant is very much larger than
the combined volume of the cytoplasm of all the cells in a culture, even in a very
dense culture, problems of product insolubility are very much less likely to arise.
Unfortunately, attaching secretion signals may not work. Proteins that are not
naturally secreted products may not pass properly through the cytoplasmic
membrane, even when directed to do so by a secretion signal.
We also need to bear in mind that our aim is usually the production of a
biologically active protein, rather than a simple polypeptide chain. Biological
activity often depends on a variety of post-translational effects, ranging from
folding of the polypeptide into the correct three-dimensional structure, to posttranslational cleavage or modifications such as glycosylation. This can be a
difficult barrier to surmount when attempting to express a protein in a foreign
host, and is often a major reason for using a non-bacterial host for expression
of eukaryotic proteins.

15.2 Expression of Cloned Genes in Bacteria
15.2.1 Transcriptional fusions
When attempting to express a foreign gene in a bacterial host, the first parameter to be considered is the requirement for a fully functional promoter attached to the cloned gene. In principle, this can be addressed by simply adding
in a known, characterized promoter in a separate cloning step. A more convenient procedure is to use a ready-prepared vector (usually a plasmid) that
already carries a suitable promoter adjacent to the cloning site. This forms a
simple type of expression vector, as already introduced in Chapter 6 (see Figure
15.3). Insertion of the cloned fragment at the cloning site (in the correct
orientation) will then put that gene under the control of the promoter carried
by the vector. In other words, transcription initiated at the promoter site will
continue through the cloned gene; since this means a fusion of the gene and the
promoter into a single transcriptional unit, it is referred to as a transcriptional
fusion (cf. translational fusions, below). This is very similar to the concept of a
reporter gene (Chapter 13), but for a different purpose. A reporter gene is used

to study the activity of the promoter. Here we know what the promoter does,
and we are using it to stimulate transcription of the cloned gene.
In E. coli there are a wide range of suitable promoters that can be used in this
way. Amongst naturally occurring promoters, the lac and trp promoters that
normally drive expression of the lac (lactose utilization) and trp (tryptophan
synthesis) operons respectively, and the PL promoter from bacteriophage
lambda are examples of commonly used promoters, the PL promoter being one
of the strongest natural promoters in E. coli (or its associated genetic elements).
However, none of these three natural promoters actually represents a perfect
match with the consensus sequence obtained by comparing the sequence of a
large number of E. coli promoters (see Box 15.1)
The À10 and À35 regions are not the sole determinants of the strength of a
promoter; a region of about 70 base pairs makes contact with the RNA
polymerase and influences the strength of that contact. Nevertheless, these
two regions (and the distance separating them) are the most highly conserved
and play the major role. Since none of these sequences is a perfect match with
the consensus, we can infer that further manipulation of the sequence could

286

MANIPULATING GENE EXPRESSION

produce even stronger promoters, and this is in fact the case. One artificial
promoter that is commonly used is known as the tac promoter, since it
represents a hybrid between the trp and lac promoters, and it is capable of
higher levels of transcription than either of the original natural promoters.
Not all promoters conform to the consensus shown. In particular, some
bacteriophage RNA polymerases (notable those from T7, T3 and SP6) have
a virtually absolute requirement for a sequence of bases, specific to that
enzyme. These polymerases will not initiate transcription from the usual promoters, nor will E. coli RNA polymerase recognize one of these special promoters. We met these enzymes in the discussion of cloning vectors (Chapter 6);
they can be very useful in ensuring that we only get expression of our cloned
gene when we need it, and not before. The ways in which we can control the
expression of our cloned gene are considered later.
In addition to the choice of promoter in our expression vector, we need also
to consider the plasmid copy number. Most routine cloning vectors for use in
E. coli are referred to as `multi-copy' plasmids, but this can conceal a wide
variation in the actual copy number. The early cloning vectors (such as
pBR322) are normally present in 15±20 copies per cell (although under special
conditions they can be amplified to up to 1000 copies per cell). Subsequent
development of these vectors removed some control elements, so that many of
the currently used vectors (such as the pUC series) have hundreds of copies per
cell. More copies of the plasmid means more copies of the cloned gene, and
hence more product formation. However, the relationship may not be linear;
you will expect to get more product from a 200-copy plasmid than from one
with only 20 copies, but not necessarily ten times as much (and indeed excessive
amounts of product may kill the cells that produce it).
So if you want to maximize gene expression, not only should you optimize
the promoter, but you should use a high copy number plasmid. Under these
conditions (assuming translation works perfectly), you may get a bacterial
clone in which your product represents up to 50 per cent of the total protein
of the cell. For commercial production, such high yields not only mean more
product per litre of culture (which is of course important) but in addition the
proportion of contaminating protein (and other material) that has to be
removed is lower, thus reducing the costs of downstream processing

15.2.2 Stability: conditional expression
There is a downside to such high levels of product formation. Producing vast
quantities of a protein that is of no use to the cell is inevitably going to result in
a reduction in growth rate, because of the amount of resources that are being
diverted in a manner that is non-productive, from the cell's perspective. This
applies even if the protein itself has no damaging effects . Slower growth rates

15.2

EXPRESSION OF CLONED GENES IN BACTERIA

287

will reduce the efficiency of the process. If the protein is directly damaging, the
problem becomes much more acute.
It is, however, much worse than that. The slower growth of the producing
cells means that there is a very strong selective pressure in favour of any of a
wide range of potential mutants that are non-productive. This includes cells
that have lost the plasmid altogether as well as any mutation to the plasmid
that reduces or prevents product formation. This can be a problem whether
you are growing a few millilitres in the laboratory or many thousands of litres
in an industrial fermenter. However, on a laboratory scale it is possible to
include antibiotic selection in your culture, to ensure that any mutants that
have lost the plasmid will be unable to grow. On a large scale this is not only an
expensive solution, but also the disposal of large volumes of antibiotic-containing waste is a problem.
One way of ameliorating this situation is to use controllable promoters, i.e.
promoters whose activity can be altered by changes in the culture conditions.
The promoters listed above provide examples of such control. For example the
lac promoter is naturally expressed only if E. coli is growing on lactose as a
carbon and energy source. (Normally bacterial geneticists use IPTG instead of
lactose, as it is both more convenient and is not broken down by the cell's bgalactosidase; it is known as a gratuitous inducer). In the absence of an inducer,
a repressor protein binds to a DNA sequence known as the operator (which in
this case overlaps with the lac promoter) and prevents transcription from the
lac promoter. The inducing agent binds to the repressor protein, altering its
conformation so that it no longer binds to the operator (Figure 15.4). We can
grow the culture to an appropriate density in the absence of an inducer, so that
we will not get high levels of gene expression and hence the selective pressure
will not exist. Then, when we have enough cells, we add the inducing agent and
switch on gene expression.
However, we have to remember that we are using a multi-copy vector. E. coli
produces enough of the repressor protein to switch off the single copy of the
promoter that it has in the chromosome, but this is not enough to switch off
several hundred copies of this promoter. We refer to the repressor being
titrated out by the presence of so many copies of the promoter. So we have
also to increase production of the repressor protein. The gene that codes for the
repressor (the lacI gene) is not actually part of the lac operon; it has its own
promoter. So one way of increasing production of the LacI repressor protein is
by using a mutated version of the lacI gene which has a more active promoter
(an up-promoter mutant). This altered lacI gene is known as lacI q . Alternatively, we can put the lacI gene onto the plasmid itself, so subjecting it to the
same gene dosage effect and therefore increasing the production of LacI.
Commonly, we would do both, i.e. put a lacI q gene onto the plasmid.
Adding IPTG to a laboratory culture is fine, but on a commercial scale it is
not an ideal solution. Adding IPTG to an industrial scale fermenter would be

very expensive as well as creating other problems (including the disposal of the
waste material).
An alternative strategy would involve the use of a promoter such as the trp
promoter, which controls transcription of the tryptophan operon. This is
subject to repression by tryptophan; E. coli switches off expression of the
tryptophan operon when the enzymes encoded by it are not needed, i.e. if
there is a plentiful supply of tryptophan. It is possible to monitor and control
the availability of tryptophan so that there is an adequate supply during the
growth phase, and then limit the supply of tryptophan when expression is
required. You may be puzzled by this. If we stop supplying tryptophan, how
is the cell going to make the protein that we want, which will probably contain
some tryptophan residues? However, it is possible to supply a low level of

15.2

EXPRESSION OF CLONED GENES IN BACTERIA

289

tryptophan which is not enough to switch off the trp promoter but will enable
production of the required protein. And we can then feed the culture continuously with a low level of tryptophan so that protein production will continue.
This may solve the problem in part, by removing the selective pressure
imposed by excessive product formation; but there is still some element of
selection imposed by the presence of so many copies of the plasmid, which may
also slow growth rates. We can counter this by using a plasmid with a different
replication origin, so that replication is tightly controlled at only one or two
copies per cell (see Chapter 6). However, the level of expression achieved with a
low copy vector will be less than that achievable with a multi-copy plasmid,
other things being equal. We can adopt a similar strategy to that described
above for programming gene expression, using a so-called runaway plasmid. If
the control of plasmid copy number is temperature sensitive, then growing the
culture initially at say 308C will produce cells with only a few copies of the
plasmid. Then, once sufficient growth has been achieved, the culture can be
shifted to a higher temperature, say 378C; control of plasmid replication is lost
and the copy number increases dramatically, until it represents perhaps 50 per
cent of the DNA of the cell. If we switch on gene expression at the same time,
we will get a very substantial amount of product. Eventually the cells will die,
but by that time we have enough of our product.
An alternative way of achieving a similar effect is by providing the vector
with two origins of replication: one that results in many copies of the plasmid,
and a second that will produce only one or two copies per cell. If we can control
which of the two origins is used, we can again switch conditions at an appropriate stage, so that the culture starts off with only a few copies of the plasmid
per cell and then when we want to switch on gene expression we can, as well as
inducing the promoter, switch to the other replication origin and increase the
copy number of the plasmid. (We do not need to consider here the details of
how that is done.)

15.2.3 Expression of lethal genes
Some genes code for products that are very damaging or even lethal to a
bacterium such as E. coli. Expression of such genes in E. coli poses obvious
problems. You might consider that the above approach would be equally
applicable in such a situation, but it is not quite that simple. The regulation
of many promoters is not tight enough. The lac promoter, for example,
although only showing full activity in the presence of an inducing agent, is
nevertheless active at a lower level even in the absence of induction. If the gene
product is very damaging, the cell will not be able to tolerate even this low level
of expression. Other promoters with tighter control, such as the T7 promoter
referred to earlier (see also Chapter 6), have to be used.

290

MANIPULATING GENE EXPRESSION

Even in the absence of a known promoter, there may be enough transcription to cause a lethal effect, since a wide variety of DNA sequences have an
artefactual low level of promoter activity. This is especially a problem with
multi-copy vectors because of the gene dosage effect, and can be reduced by
using tightly controlled low copy vectors. Alternatively, obtaining high levels
of production of a protein that is highly damaging to E. coli may require the use
of an alternative host.

15.2.4 Translational fusions
If we want to provide our gene with translational signals (ribosome binding site
and start codon) as well as a promoter, we can use a similar approach. For this
purpose we need a different type of expression vector: one that will give rise to a
translational fusion. In this case, part of the translation product (the protein or
polypeptide) is derived from the insert and part from the vector (Figure 15.5).
When using a translational fusion vector, we have to be much more careful in
the design of our construct.

With a transcriptional fusion vector, as described above, we simply have to
make sure the insert is the right way round. Within reason, it does not matter
too much where it is ± some untranslated leader mRNA can be tolerated, so it
does not have to be precisely located with respect to the promoter. However,
with a translational fusion, the location is all important. Since translation starts
at the initiation codon in the vector sequence and the ribosomes then read the
sequence in triplets, you have to make sure that the correct reading frame is
maintained at the junction. One or two bases out in either direction, and your
insert will be read in the wrong frame, giving rise to a completely different
amino acid sequence (and probably resulting in premature termination as the
ribosomes will soon come across a stop codon in this frame ± see Figure 15.6).
You can only achieve this if you know the sequence of your insert, and the
sequence of the vector, or at least of that region of the vector between the
cloning site and the start codon. (Contrast this with a transcriptional fusion
vector, where it is quite possible to insert an uncharacterized DNA fragment
into the vector and be successful in obtaining expression.) Furthermore you
have to work out exactly what will happen at the cloning site when you cut the
insert and the vector and then join them together. If you are relying on a
restriction site that is naturally present in the insert, there is only a one in
three chance that it will be in the right frame when joined to the vector, even
assuming the insert goes in the right way round. You might need to alter your
choice of vector, or to modify either the vector or the insert (e.g. by using linkers
or adaptors). Alternatively, you can use PCR to generate the insert fragment,

292

MANIPULATING GENE EXPRESSION

in which case you must design the primer to contain a restriction site that will
produce the correct reading frame (see Chapter 9).
Finally, having done all this, it is essential to check, as always, by sequencing
the recombinant product, that ligation has indeed resulted in the construct that
you have designed, and that the reading frame is actually correct. Loss of a
single base during ligation will result in an incorrect reading frame.
In theory, it is possible to use a vector which just has the ribosome binding
site and no start codon, and to use the natural start codon of the cloned gene.
However, in E. coli the optimum distance between the Shine±Dalgarno sequence and the start codon is only five to seven bases, so there is not a lot of
room for manoeuvre. More commonly the vector will have the start codon as
well, and the insert will not have a start codon. In this case, the translational
fusion product will have a few amino acids derived from the vector sequence,
and will lack some of the N-terminal amino acids that are normally found in
this polypeptide. For many purposes, this is of little significance, as proteins
can often tolerate a considerable amount of variation in the N-terminal sequence. In some cases it may be important to have a product that is precisely
the same as the naturally occurring one ± for example if you are making a
protein for human therapeutic purposes. You will then need to carry out more
precise manipulations rather than using off the shelf expression vectors; for
example, you can ensure that the vector-derived amino acids replace exactly
those that are lost from the insert.
Sometimes, it is useful to be able to add a short sequence of amino acids to
the N-terminus of your product. We will consider the applications of such
tagged proteins later in this chapter.

15.3 Expression in Eukaryotic Host Cells
Although bacteria are convenient hosts for many purposes, and E. coli is
usually the host of choice for initial gene cloning (including the production of
primary gene libraries), bacterial systems have many limitations for the expression of cloned genes, especially for large-scale production of proteins of eukaryotic origin. In particular, the post-translational modifications needed for
conversion of the primary product of translation into the mature, folded,
biologically active product are more likely to occur in a eukaryotic host.
There is a wide variety of systems available; in this chapter we will consider
just a few examples. Many of the concepts discussed in relation to bacterial
gene expression are also relevant to expression in eukaryotic cells, even if the
details are different.

15.3 EXPRESSION IN EUKARYOTIC HOST CELLS

293

15.3.1 Yeast expression systems
Yeasts have many advantages for expression of cloned genes. They grow
rapidly, in simple defined media, and as unicellular organisms they are relatively easy to manipulate and enumerate. Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been
used as an experimental organism in microbial genetics for many years and
there is now a wealth of biochemical and genetic information available to
support its use for gene cloning ± including the genome sequence. Powerful
and versatile systems are also available for several other yeast species, notably
Pichia pastoris.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae
Vectors for cloning and expression of genes in the yeast S. cerevisiae were
introduced in Chapter 6. In many respects, especially if using episomally
replicating vectors, the concepts are similar to those involved in the design of
plasmid-based expression vectors in bacteria. There is a choice between vectors
carrying the 2mm origin of replication, which are maintained episomally at
high copy number (up to 40 copies per cell) , and centromere vectors which are
maintained at low copy number (one to two copies per cell) (see Chapter 6 for
more detail). Both types of vectors are designed as shuttle vectors, that is they
also carry an E. coli replication origin, which enables the initial construction
and verification of the recombinant plasmid to be carried out in E. coli before
transferring the finished construct into yeast cells. As with bacterial expression
vectors, these S. cerevisiae vectors are designed with a controllable promoter
adjacent to the cloning site to enable expression of the cloned gene to be
switched on or off. Most commonly this involves the promoter and enhancer
sequences from the GAL1 (galactokinase) gene, which is strongly induced by
the addition of galactose.

Pichia pastoris
Pichia pastoris is able to use methanol as a carbon source, the first step in the
pathway being due to the enzyme alcohol oxidase (the product of the AOX1
gene). This gene is tightly controlled, so that in the absence of methanol no
alcohol oxidase is detectable. On addition of methanol to the culture, the
AOX1 gene is expressed at a very high level. The use of the AOX1 promoter
in the expression vectors, adjacent to the cloning site, therefore provides
vectors that are capable of generating substantial levels (up to several grams
per litre) of the required product.

294

MANIPULATING GENE EXPRESSION

Unlike the bacterial systems, the vectors in P. pastoris are not maintained
episomally, but are designed to be integrated into the yeast chromosome. They
do, however, contain an E. coli replication origin, so that they are maintained
as plasmids in E. coli, enabling formation and verification of the recombinant
plasmids in E. coli before transformation of Pichia.
Not only are the expression levels in Pichia usually higher than those
obtainable in other systems (prokaryotic or eukaryotic), but scaling up to
industrial levels of production is relatively straightforward, and the organism
grows readily in simple defined media, leading to lower costs than those
involved in insect or mammalian systems (as described below).

15.3.2 Expression in insect cells: baculovirus systems
Baculoviruses, such as the Autographa california nuclear polyhedrosis virus
(AcMNPV), infect insect cells and are exploited as the basis of systems for gene
expression in such cells. During normal infection, large amounts of a virusencoded protein called polyhedrin are produced which forms a matrix within
which the virus particles are embedded. The high level of production of polyhedrin is due to a very strong promoter, which can be used to drive expression
of the cloned gene, by inserting it downstream from the polyhedrin promoter.
Production of polyhedrin itself is not completely essential for virus production,
but in its absence the virus does not produce inclusions; the resultant plaques
can be distinguished from those produced by wild-type virus. However, the
viral DNA is itself too large (> 100kb) for direct manipulation to be carried out
easily. The gene to be expressed is therefore first inserted into the polyhedrin
gene in a smaller transfer vector. Once again, the transfer vector is a shuttle
vector, i.e. it contains an E. coli origin of replication and other functions that
allow manipulation in an E. coli host. For production of recombinant virus
particles, the transfer vector must recombine with viral DNA. For this to
happen, insect cells are cotransfected with the recombinant transfer vector
and with viral DNA. Recombination within the insect cells leads to the
production of recombinant viruses. These are separated from the wild-type,
non-recombinant, viruses by picking the plaques that are characteristic of
polyhedrin-deficient viruses.
More efficient versions of this system are now available. In the example
shown in Figure 15.7, the transfer vector contains a multiple cloning site
adjacent to (and downstream from) the polyhedrin promoter so that the cloned
gene will be transcribed from that promoter. Flanking this region, on either
side, are two DNA regions derived from the virus that allow homologous
recombination with viral DNA. For the other component of the system,
instead of intact viral DNA, a linearized DNA is used. The linearized viral
DNA lacks a portion of an essential gene, thus eliminating the production of

non-recombinant viruses. Recombination with the transfer vector, after
cotransfection of insect cells, restores this essential gene. Additional features
can be built in to this system, including the incorporation of a marker such as
b-galactosidase into the transfer vector so that blue recombinant plaques can
be readily identified.
Following transfection, viral plaques can be picked and the virus characterized to verify the presence of the cloned gene. The characterized recombinant

296

virus can then be used to infect a large-scale culture of insect cells; high levels
of expressed protein are usually obtained before the cells lyse. The levels of
production are generally lower than those obtainable with Pichia expression
systems, but insect cells are claimed to provide post-translational modification
that is more closely similar to that in mammalian cells. On the other hand, the
yeast cells are much easier and cheaper to grow.

15.3.3 Expression in mammalian cells
There is an enormous variety of expression vectors and systems for use with
mammalian cells, and a full treatment of this field is way beyond the scope of
this book. Although the details are more complex than the systems described so
far, the general principles remain familiar.
Most vectors use the enhancer/promoters from the human cytomegalovirus
(CMV), the SV40 virus, or the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HS-TK)
to drive transcription. These give high level, constitutive, expression. As in
prokaryotic systems, it is sometimes desirable to control the onset of expression. One way of achieving such regulation is by interposing the operator
sequence (tetO) from the bacterial tetracycline resistance operon between the
promoter and the cloned gene. If the mammalian cells are cotransfected with a
second plasmid containing the tetracycline repressor gene (tetR), also expressed using the CMV promoter, the TetR protein will bind to the tetO site,
thus preventing transcription. When tetracycline is added to the culture
medium it will bind to the TetR protein, altering its conformation and releasing
it from the DNA, thus derepressing transcription of the cloned gene. The
advantage of this is that, because this system is of prokaryotic origin, its
activation does not affect the induction of native mammalian genes. Similarly,
an insect ecdysone-responsive element is sometimes used to induce gene expression in mammalian cells. Like the tetracycline system, ecdysone does not have
any effect on native mammalian genes, and the induction is therefore specific to
the genes placed under its control.
Additional sequences can be added to enable targeting of the product to
specific cellular locations such as the nucleus, mitochondria, endoplasmic
reticulum or cytoplasm, or secretion into the culture medium.
In contrast to bacterial cells, the introduction of DNA into mammalian cells
does not depend on the independent replication of the vector; the introduced
DNA can be stably integrated into the nuclear DNA. However, some expression vectors can be stably maintained at high copy extrachromosomally, such
as those containing the origin of replication from the Epstein Barr Virus
(EBV); with a suitable promoter system these are capable of allowing high
levels of protein expression. The use of retroviral vectors for integrating foreign
genes in mammalian genomes, and for obtaining gene expression, was con-

sidered in Chapter 6; for the application of these techniques in whole animals,
see Chapter 17.
The advantage of using mammalian cells for expression of eukaryotic genes,
especially those from mammalian sources, rather than the other systems described, lies in the greater likelihood of a functional product being obtained.
This is especially relevant for studies of structure±function relationships and
the physiological effect of the protein on cell function. However, the relative
difficulty, and cost, of scaling up production, compared with either Pichia or
baculovirus systems, makes mammalian cells less attractive if the objective is
the large-scale production of recombinant proteins for other uses.

15.4 Adding Tags and Signals
15.4.1 Tagged proteins
The fact that a translational fusion vector (see above) can add a short stretch of
amino acids to the N-terminal end of your polypeptide product can be turned
to advantage. Purification of the recombinant product by conventional means
can often be tedious and inefficient. However, if the vector contains not just a
start codon but also a short sequence coding for a few amino acids (known as a
tag), the resulting fusion protein will carry this tag at the N-terminus. For
example, the tag may constitute a recognition site (an epitope) that can be
recognized by a monoclonal antibody (see Chapter 8, Box 8.2). You can then
recover the protein from the cell extract in a single step by affinity purification,
using the ability of the monoclonal antibody to bind to the epitope tag (Figure
15.8). A further application of this type of vector is that you can use this
specific monoclonal antibody to detect the expression of your product, if you
have no other reasonably convenient assay. There is a variety of such tags (and
corresponding monoclonal antibodies) available, and they can be added to
either end of your insert (N- or C-termini), using modified PCR primers, rather
than by incorporation into the vector.
An alternative to epitope tagging is provided by designing the expression
vector (or manipulating the insert) so that a sequence coding for a number of
histidine residues is added to one end of the sequence to be expressed. This will
produce a His-tagged protein which can be purified using a Ni2 resin. The
affinity of the histidine residues for nickel will result in the tagged protein being
retained by the resin, while other proteins will be washed through. The His-tag
can also be used as an epitope tag, since there are antibodies available that will
specifically recognize this sequence of histidine residues, which facilitates detection of the tagged product.

Of course you may not want to have a tag permanently attached to your
product. For this reason, vectors can be designed to contain not only the tag but
also a site at which the product can be cleaved by highly specific peptidases. If
the peptidase is sufficiently specific it will cleave the product only at this site and
not elsewhere. Therefore you can affinity purify your product, cleave it with the
peptidase, and separate the protein from the cleaved tag (see Figure 15.8).

15.4.2 Secretion signals
In a similar way to the incorporation of tags into the product, we can add
secretion signals. E. coli does not secrete many proteins into the culture
supernatant ± most of the proteins secreted across the cytoplasmic membrane
remain in the periplasm, trapped by the outer membrane. In some other

15.5

IN VITRO MUTAGENESIS

299

bacteria, particularly Gram positive bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis, many
enzymes are secreted into the culture supernatant. This can be advantageous
for several reasons. First, if a protein is synthesized at high levels and accumulated within the cytoplasm, it will result in a very high concentration of that
protein. This can cause aggregation of the protein into insoluble inclusion
bodies. These may be damaging to the cell, and are often very difficult to
resolubilize. Secretion of the protein into the culture medium will prevent this,
since the volume of the supernatant is very much greater than that of the total
volume of the cytoplasm of all the cells. Even with a very dense culture, the space
occupied by the cells is only a small proportion of the culture volume. Furthermore, although Bacillus secretes a number of enzymes, the culture supernatant
will contain a much simpler mixture of proteins than the cell cytoplasm. The
task of purifying the required product is therefore much simpler.
Secretion of proteins by bacteria depends normally on the presence of a
signal peptide at the N-terminus. This labels it as a secreted protein, so it is
recognized by the secretion machinery and transported across the cytoplasmic
membrane. Therefore if we incorporate a sequence coding for a signal peptide
into our vector (or into the insert) the final product may be secreted. It is not
inevitable, as it also depends on the overall structure of the protein. If the
protein is naturally secreted in its original host, then we may be successful. If it
is normally a cytoplasmic protein, the chances of getting it secreted successfully
are very much lower.
As described above, in mammalian systems, signals can be added to direct
the product to specific cellular locations, or to obtain a secreted product.

15.5 In vitro Mutagenesis
In the early part of this chapter we described how codon usage may affect
optimization of gene expression in E. coli, and in other hosts may prevent
expression altogether. What can we do about it?
If we can identify a limited number of rarely-used codons in our cloned gene,
which are likely to cause a reduction in gene expression, then we can use sitedirected mutagenesis (see below) to alter the sequence at these specific positions,
so as to change a rare codon into a more appropriate one ± still maintaining the
same coding properties so we are not altering the nature of the final product.
If there are a large number of such rare codons, then changing them one by
one would be extremely laborious. Similarly, if we decide that the base composition of the sequence is causing problems, it would be excessively tedious to
use site-directed mutagenesis to change the whole thing. In these situations
we could use synthetic techniques to remake the complete gene ± either by
direct DNA synthesis or by PCR-based methods such as assembly PCR. All
these techniques are described in the subsequent sections. Their potential

300

MANIPULATING GENE EXPRESSION

applications extend far beyond adjusting codon usage, into a field known as
protein engineering.

15.5.1 Site-directed mutagenesis
This refers to the specific alteration of either a single base or a short sequence of
bases in a cloned gene. If there is a unique restriction site within your cloned
DNA fragment, at or near the point where you want to make a change, then
there are several simple possibilities, including the use of exonucleases to make
a short deletion, and/or the insertion of a short synthetic oligonucleotide
(Figure 15.9). Although these methods are limited in their scope they can be
useful, for example in the removal or addition of restriction sites within a DNA
fragment. In addition, the deletion procedure will remove various lengths of
DNA, which enables you to identify the limits of regions that have specific
functions, such as the ability to bind regulatory proteins (see Chapter 13).
Those deletions which extend into the regulatory region will produce clones
showing altered regulation of the gene concerned.
The fundamental limitation is the requirement for a unique restriction site at
the appropriate place. More generally applicable techniques involve the use of

oligonucleotide primers to introduce changes in the DNA sequence. There are
a number of variations in the technique, so we will just describe the principle of
the method.
Fundamentally, it relies on the ability of single-strand DNA molecules to
anneal to one another even if their sequences do not match perfectly. Therefore,
if we design an oligonucleotide that contains the sequence we require, which is
only slightly different from the natural sequence, it will anneal to the complementary strand at the corresponding position. This provides a primer that can
be used by DNA polymerase. If we start with a single-stranded circular DNA
molecule (such as can be readily obtained using an M13 vector, see Chapter 6),
then DNA polymerase will synthesize the complementary strand right round
the circle, producing a double-stranded molecule (Figure 15.10). DNA ligase

can then seal the nick to produce a completely closed, double-stranded, circular
molecule in which one strand contains the natural sequence and the second
strand carries the required mutation (a heteroduplex DNA). When you transform E. coli with this, subsequent replication will produce some doublestranded circular DNA molecules with the wild-type sequence, and some
with the mutation. If this is done with an M13 vector, the result will be a
mixture of mutant and non-mutant phages.
This is not a very efficient system. Even if everything goes perfectly, the best
you can expect is that 50 per cent of the clones will carry the mutation. In
practice the proportion of mutant clones is usually considerably lower than
this, for a variety of reasons. Predominantly, we have to take account of the
mismatch repair system in the host cells. The repair of mismatched DNA
occurs preferentially on the new (in vitro generated) strand, which is unmethylated, rather than on the old, (in vivo generated) strand, which is methylated.
There are ways around some of these problems, including the use of host
strains that are defective in mismatch repair, and other procedures that selectively eliminate the parental DNA strand.
There are also a variety of PCR-based methods, which are more efficient. A
simple PCR reaction can be used if the site of the desired mutation is near
enough to the end of the gene so that a primer containing the mismatch can be
used. Usually, however, the site for the mutation will be too far from the end
for this simple approach to be useful. In that case, you have to use a more
complex method. The simplest, conceptually if not practically, is to start with
two PCR reactions that produce products which overlap in the region of the
mutation; in Figure 15.11, primer B, used in PCR reaction 1, is complementary
to primer C used in the second PCR. Both primers contain the required
alteration in the sequence (but on opposite strands). If you mix the products
of the two reactions, denature and re-anneal, some of the single strands from
reaction 1 will anneal to strands from reaction 2 in the region where they
overlap, corresponding to the sequences of primers B and C. (Of course,
there will also be re-annealing of the products of PCR 1, and similarly of the
products of PCR 2; these are not shown in the figure, and will not be amplified
by the subsequent PCR.) One of the two possible hybrid molecules contains 3H
ends which can act as a primer for extension by DNA polymerase to produce a
complete double-stranded molecule containing the mutation (on both strands).
The other type of hybrid DNA cannot be so extended, as the overlap region has
5H ends. A subsequent PCR, using the outermost primers (A and D) will
amplify only the full-length product as shown. This can then be cloned in
order to test the consequences of the mutation.
The early applications of PCR for site-directed mutagenesis suffered from
the risk of introducing unwanted mutations into the product, due to the
absence of proof-reading ability of Taq polymerase. The introduction of alternative heat-stable polymerases which do have proof-reading ability, and hence

show greater fidelity, has greatly enhanced the application of PCR for this
purpose. Nevertheless, as always, it is important to sequence the product to
ensure first that the required mutation has indeed been achieved, and second
that no other alterations have been introduced into the sequence.

15.5.2 Synthetic genes
As indicated previously, although it is possible to use site-directed mutagenesis
to introduce a number of changes into the sequence of a gene, it becomes a
rather laborious procedure if we want to make extensive changes ± such as
altering the codon usage throughout. One possibility then is to abandon the
natural gene and simply synthesize a fresh one from scratch. We would take the
amino acid sequence of the protein and use an optimal set of codons to back
translate it (in a computer, not on the bench) into a nucleic acid sequence with
optimized codon usage (and/or optimized base composition). It is actually
rather more complicated than that, as you would want to check that you are
not introducing other undesirable features such as secondary structures that
might interfere with transcription; you also would want to consider the introduction (or omission) of restriction endonuclease sites at strategic points.
In principle, you would program a DNA synthesizer to make the DNA
sequence which could then be cloned. Here again, it is not quite that simple.

304

MANIPULATING GENE EXPRESSION

DNA synthesizers work by adding bases sequentially, one at a time, to the
growing oligonucleotide through a series of chemical reactions and washing
steps. With each base added, there is a very small but finite possibility of the
failure of the reaction, the main consequence of which is a gradual reduction in
the yield of the product. Synthesis of oligonucleotides of 30±50 bases long is
very reliable, and longer sequences can be made, but the practical limit is not
much more than 100 bases. One way round this is to make the gene in shorter
fragments and ligate them, bearing in mind that the synthesizer produces
single-stranded DNA, so you need to make two complementary strands for
each fragment. This would clearly involve a lot of work, but if you really need
to do it, it is quite possible.

15.5.3 Assembly PCR
An alternative procedure, which is a lot simpler in practice than that described
above, is simply to mix together a complete set of synthetic fragments (each of
which overlaps, and is complementary to, its neighbours on either side). As
before, these fragments are designed to optimize codon usage and base composition, at the same time avoiding sequences that would lead to structures
such as hairpin formation. This complex mixture is then subjected to a number
of rounds of PCR, which results in, amongst other products, some full-length
DNA. This is further amplified, specifically, by addition of primers directed at
the ends of the full-length gene, and further rounds of PCR. Although the
synthesis of a complete gene of say 1000 base pairs involves a highly complex
mixture of starting oligonucleotides, which might be expected to produce an
impossible number of different products, the procedure can be surprisingly
successful. We have successfully used it to produce a 300 bp fragment with
radically different codon usage and base composition for expressing a gene
from the malaria parasite Plasmodium (30 per cent GC) in a mycobacterial
host (65 per cent GC).

15.5.4 Protein engineering
The above discussion refers to the use of site-directed mutagenesis and synthetic DNA as a means of altering the base composition and/or codon usage of
a naturally occurring gene, as an aid to expressing that gene. The product is still
the same as the naturally occurring one. However, there is no reason why we
should limit these techniques to the production of naturally occurring proteins.
We can just as easily synthesize a gene which codes for an altered protein. We
could introduce specific changes into the sequence and test their effects on,
for example, the substrate specificity of the enzyme. Or we could introduce

15.5

IN VITRO MUTAGENESIS

305

cysteine residues into the sequence at strategic points so that the protein
produced would contain additional disulphide bridges. This would be expected
to increase the thermal stability of the enzyme, which could be advantageous.
(Unfortunately such a change often results in the loss of enzyme activity as
well.)
This concept, often referred to as protein engineering, would in principle
culminate in the production of totally novel enzymes, tailor-made to carry out
specific enzyme reactions. The limiting factor now is not the techniques for
producing such engineered proteins, but the inadequacy of our knowledge of
how a specific sequence of amino acids will fold into a three-dimensional
structure, and how we can predict the enzymic activity of such a novel protein.

16 Medical
Applications,
Present and Future
Genetic technology has many applications relevant to human medicine. Some
of these have already been considered to some extent: detection and differentiation of microbial pathogens, and research and diagnosis of human genetic
diseases, for example. In this chapter, we want to consider a few topics in more
detail.

16.1 Vaccines
One example of the application of gene technology is in the development of
new vaccines. Until recently, all vaccines were one of three types.
(1) Killed vaccines (such as the Salk polio vaccine), in which a suspension of
the pathogen was inactivated, for example by heating it, so as to retain its
immunogenicity but rendering it incapable of causing disease. Influenza vaccines are also of this type.
(2) Live attenuated vaccines, which use a mutant strain of the pathogen which
is attenuated (i.e. it has lost the ability to cause disease) but is still immunogenic. Many familiar vaccines are of this type, including vaccinia (smallpox
vaccine), oral polio vaccine (Sabin), and BCG (an attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis, used for protection against tuberculosis).
(3) Toxoids. Some bacterial diseases are due to the ability of the bacterium to
produce a specific toxin; immunity to the toxin gives protection against the
disease. If you can inactivate the toxin (e.g. by chemical treatment) while
retaining its immunogenicity, the resulting toxoid will be an effective vaccine.
The principal examples here are diphtheria and tetanus vaccines.
To these three types we can add a fourth, even without resorting to gene
technology. Some killed vaccines, although giving good protection, also have

308

MEDICAL APPLICATIONS, PRESENT AND FUTURE

undesirable side effects. If we can separate the components of the vaccine that
are needed for protection from those that cause the side effects, we will have an
equally effective, but much safer, vaccine. For example, the old pertussis
vaccine consisted of a killed suspension of Bordetella pertussis, the bacterium
that causes whooping cough. From this complex mixture, it is possible to
purify the components that are needed for the protective effect, producing a
safer vaccine. A vaccine of this type is known as a subunit vaccine.
Gene technology can contribute to the development of new vaccines by
introducing more convenient and more versatile ways of producing vaccines
of the above types, e.g. by new ways of attenuating virulent strains, or by
producing subunit vaccines using cloned genes. In addition, genetic manipulation allows the development of totally new types of vaccines, for example by
expressing relevant genes from one or more pathogens in an avirulent host
strain, or in a more radical departure, by constructing recombinant DNA
molecules that can be used as a vaccine in their own right, without using a
host organism to carry them. This chapter will consider these developments, as
summarized in Figure 16.1, although it should be noted that there are other
technologies that also contribute to the development of novel vaccines, such as
the use of synthetic peptides, and conjugate vaccines (in which a polysaccharide
antigen is linked to a protein carrier); since these technologies do not involve
genetic manipulation they are outside the scope of this book.

16.1.1 Subunit vaccines
The concept behind the use of genetic manipulation to produce a recombinant
subunit vaccine is simple. If you can identify the key (protein) antigen from the
pathogen that is needed for a protective effect, you can clone the gene responsible using an expression vector and produce large quantities of the protein.
This has many advantages over producing the same component from the
pathogen itself: it is cheaper and more effective, since you may get much higher
levels of expression; it is easier to produce a safe vaccine, as there is no problem
with contamination with any other damaging components of the vaccine; and
the production process is safer, since you do not have to grow large-scale
cultures of a dangerous pathogen.
The best example, illustrating the power of this approach (as well as some of
the problems), is the development of a vaccine against the hepatitis B virus,
which causes a serious form of hepatitis and is transmitted sexually, as well as
by blood products and by direct inoculation (e.g. using contaminated syringe
needles). Unfortunately, this virus cannot be grown in cell culture, which
makes the development of a conventional vaccine next to impossible. (Vaccines
have been produced using viral particles purified from the blood of human
carriers of the virus, but supplies are limited and the risk of transmitting other
diseases is obvious). However, we know that one virus protein, the surface
antigen (HbSAg, see Figure 16.2) is able to confer protection, so the expression
of this gene in a suitable host should yield a product that can be used as a
vaccine. However, when this gene was expressed in E. coli, it was found that the
product did not give effective protection. The problem here is that the product
from E. coli, although having the authentic amino acid sequence, does not
adopt the correct conformation. However, it was found that the expression of
this gene in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae did give rise to HbSAg with a
natural conformation, and this product was immunogenic and protective ± and
this is the basis of the currently used hepatitis B vaccine.

MEDICAL APPLICATIONS, PRESENT AND FUTURE

We can also use genetic manipulation as an alternative to chemical treatment
of toxins as a way of producing toxoids for immunization. For example, the
cholera toxin consists of two types of subunit: the A component is responsible
for the toxic effects after it gets into the target cells, while the B component is
needed for attachment to cell surface receptors. The B component by itself is
non toxic. Expression of the B component alone will give a product that can
cause an immune response without the toxicity of the intact toxin.
We can also manipulate the product so as to cause an immune response to
specific regions of the antigen. For certain viruses, immunization with the
whole virus will produce a response that is directed mainly towards certain
exposed regions of the major antigens ± they are said to be immunodominant.
However, these are often the very regions that are most variable; evolution has
ensured that this happens. Other regions of the antigen may be more conserved, but we do not usually make a good immune response to those regions,
because they are hidden. If we use gene cloning to express just the conserved
region of the antigen, we may be able to force an immune response against the
conserved regions of the antigen rather than the hypervariable ones ± thus
potentially establishing a vaccine that would protect against a wider range of
strains.

16.1.2 Live attenuated vaccines
One of the limitations of non-living vaccines, including both conventional
killed vaccines and subunit vaccines, is that the protective effect on initial
immunization can be relatively poor and short-lived. Boosters are commonly
needed, but even so the protection is usually inferior to that conferred by a live
vaccine.
The conventional route for development of a live attenuated vaccine involves
repeated laboratory subculture, especially under non-favourable conditions.
For example, a virus may be repeatedly cultured using a cell line that is a poor
host for the wild virus, or a bacterium may be repeatedly grown using a
medium in which the pathogen grows very weakly. The TB vaccine BCG was
developed by repeated subculture on potato slices soaked in glycerol and ox
bile over some 20 years. The principle is that as the pathogen adapts to these
unusual conditions it will at the same time lose the ability to infect human or
animal hosts. The only way of testing this is to examine the virulence of the
organism at intervals ± usually by challenge of an experimental animal model.
If there is no suitable animal model, virulence tests are difficult.
Although this empirical procedure has been successful in producing several
widely used vaccines, it is rather hit and miss. Many mutations are likely to
accumulate, apart from those that give rise to the desired attenuation, so there
is a good deal of uncertainty in the nature of the resulting strain. For a virus, it

16.1

VACCINES

311

is now relatively straightforward to determine the sequence of the candidate
vaccine ± and even for the much larger genome of a bacterium, determining the
genome sequence of the potential vaccine, and comparing it with the original
sequence of the pathogen, is becoming a routine possibility. However, it is still
difficult to know which of these mutations is associated with loss of virulence.
It can be important to understand the nature of the loss of virulence. If it is
due to just a single mutation, and especially if that is a simple point mutation
(i.e. a change in the base sequence at a single position), then it is quite possible
for that mutation to revert. In other words, a further mutation at that site may
restore the original sequence of the gene, and the strain is no longer attenuated.
This can happen, for example, with the live polio vaccine. The vaccine itself is
safe, but the attenuated virus persists for some time in the body (which of
course contributes to its success in stimulating a good immune response).
During that time, there is continued opportunity for it to revert to a virulent
form. This does not do any direct damage, as the person `infected' is protected
by the immunity generated by vaccination. However, vaccinated individuals
shed, for a time, virus into the environment, and if it has reverted to a virulent
form, any non-immunized individuals who come into contact with this revertant are at risk of contracting polio. As the polio eradication campaign becomes
increasingly successful, and the natural occurrence of the virus diminishes,
reversion of the vaccine strain becomes a potentially significant cause of the
continuation of this disease.
It is also necessary to recognize the possibility that the strain will not only
have lost virulence, but also may have lost the ability to induce protection. The
structure of the key antigens may have changed for example. Furthermore, it is
possible for a strain to become too attenuated. The most effective protection is
achieved by a virus or bacterium that is able to undergo at least a limited degree
of replication in the tissues before being eliminated by the host defences. If the
strain is over-attenuated, the body will eliminate it before it has a chance to
evoke a full immune response.
With the classical empirical procedure, it is difficult to control these factors.
You have to produce many different variants and test each one for both
properties: the loss of virulence, and the ability to produce protective immunity. Genetic technology provides rational ways of achieving these goals in a
controlled manner. With some of the smaller viruses, it is possible to use sitedirected mutagenesis (Chapter 15) to modify selected genes with the goal of
attenuating the virus. With larger viruses, this is usually not possible directly,
but indirect techniques can be used to introduce defined mutations. However,
unless you have a thorough knowledge of the structure of the virus, most of
your mutations are likely to destroy the viability of the virus altogether, rather
than just removing its virulence.
The larger genome of a bacterium provides more targets, and potentially
many that would eliminate virulence while still retaining the ability to grow in

312

MEDICAL APPLICATIONS, PRESENT AND FUTURE

the laboratory. However, we cannot alter these genes by direct site-directed
mutagenesis. In Chapter 14, however, we described the use of allele replacement, or gene knockouts, for the removal or inactivation of specific genes. We
can use this process to develop attenuated strains that may be useful as vaccine
candidates.
This requires some knowledge of the genes that are necessary for virulence. If
pathogenicity is due to the production of a protein toxin, then you would
expect the inactivation of the toxin gene to produce an attenuated derivative.
Usually it is not so easy. With most bacteria, pathogenicity is multi-factorial.
Much effort is being devoted to attempts to identify genes that are needed for
virulence, especially by identifying genes that are selectively expressed during
infection (using for example the techniques described in Chapters 13 and 14) ±
which would identify targets that could be knocked out in order to attenuate
the bacterium.
The most successful approach so far has been to target genes that are
involved in certain central biochemical pathways rather than the more obvious
virulence genes. This takes advantage of knowledge that the bacterium at the
site of infection will not have a ready supply of some key substrates, such as
some amino acids. It will have to make them for itself. Mutants in which key
genes in that pathway have been disrupted will therefore be unable to multiply
in the body. Of course we can still grow these strains in the laboratory, simply
by adding the required amino acid to the medium. One such pathway is that for
aromatic amino acid biosynthesis. Salmonella mutants in which the aroA gene
has been disrupted have reduced virulence, although not sufficiently attenuated
for vaccine use.

16.1.3 Live recombinant vaccines
One of the novel advances in vaccine technology that has been made possible
by genetic manipulation is the construction of vaccines that confer immunity to
several diseases simultaneously. This can be achieved by inserting the genes for
key antigens from different pathogens into a single live vaccine. Much of this
work has been carried out using the vaccinia virus (the smallpox vaccine) as the
carrier. Vaccinia is a rather large and inconvenient virus to use for genetic
manipulation (with a genome size of 187 kb), and the insertion of genes
requires the use of in vivo recombination. This is shown schematically in
Figure 16.3. The required gene is inserted into an E. coli vector, adjacent to a
promoter derived from vaccinia. This plasmid also carries a defective thymidine kinase (TK) gene from vaccinia, interrupted by the promoter and the
cloning site. If an animal cell is infected with vaccinia virus, and at the same
time transformed with the recombinant plasmid, the homology between

plasmid and vaccinia DNA after co-infecting animal cells; the resulting recombinant is
TK, and expresses the insert gene from the vaccinia promoter

the TK genes on the plasmid and the virus will allow specific homologous
recombination, resulting in the incorporation of the insert from the recombinant plasmid, together with the adjacent promoter, into the viral DNA. The
recombinant virus now lacks a functional TK gene, which provides a way of
selecting the recombinants.
Antigens from a wide variety of viruses, and other pathogens, have been
expressed in this way as recombinant vaccinia viruses. In one example, a
recombinant vaccinia virus expressing a gene from the rabies virus was formulated into a bait for oral immunization of animals in the wild against rabies in
parts of Europe. The applications of vaccinia recombinants are not limited to
single antigens. It is possible to insert several genes, from different sources, into
vaccinia, producing candidate vaccines that are capable of immunizing simultaneously against several different diseases.
However, vaccinia is not an ideal candidate vector for human vaccines.
Despite its widespread use in the smallpox eradication campaign, it is not a
very safe vaccine: for example, it is not suitable for people with skin conditions
such as eczema, nor for people who are immunodeficient. However, there are

314

MEDICAL APPLICATIONS, PRESENT AND FUTURE

other candidate carriers, notably attenuated strains of Salmonella and also the
TB vaccine BCG. These are very safe vaccines, and the manipulations involved
are relatively straightforward. At a basic level, you simply clone the genes you
want on a shuttle vector, including appropriate expression signals, and transform the chosen host. Ultimately there are further considerations: we usually
use antibiotic resistance genes as a selectable marker for this; for practical use
as a vaccine, the inclusion of resistance genes is unlikely to be acceptable, and
alternative strategies have to be adopted. Furthermore, plasmids are generally
not completely stable, and insertion into the chromosome is preferred. One
way of achieving this is to use a suicide plasmid with a bacteriophage integration system. The expression of the phage integrase then recombines the plasmid
with the attachment site on the chromosome. There is a wide range of such
potential vaccines at different stages of development.

16.1.4 DNA vaccines
The most radical of the new approaches stems from the surprising observation
that injection of DNA, usually as a recombinant plasmid containing the
relevant genes, is able to stimulate an immune response to the product of
those genes, and in some cases this leads to protective immunity. This presumably occurs because the plasmid is taken up by some of the cells in the body,
resulting in expression of the genes carried by the plasmid. One advantage of
this approach is the ease of administering the vaccine. The plasmid DNA can
be coated onto tiny inert particles which are projected at high velocity into
the skin, penetrating a very short distance below the surface of the skin (see
also the discussion of biolistics in Chapter 17). The particles are small enough,
and the velocity is high enough, for the particles to penetrate into cells within
the skin. The plasmid is constructed so that the genes to be expressed are
located downstream from a strong constitutive promoter (such as the CMV
promoter, see Chapter 6). Although the plasmid is not replicated within these
cells, there is sufficient transient expression of the cloned genes to generate
an immune response. DNA vaccines represent an exciting new development
in vaccine technology. However, we have to recognize that there are many
questions to be answered before they are accepted for widespread use in
humans.
At the same time, this technique has achieved extensive use as a means of
raising antibodies to recombinant proteins in experimental animals. Instead of
the time-consuming procedure of purifying the protein and immunizing
animals in the conventional way (see Box 8.2), a recombinant plasmid, carrying
the cloned gene together with appropriate expression signals, can be used
directly as an immunogen.

DETECTION AND IDENTIFICATION OF PATHOGENS

16.2 Detection and Identification of Pathogens
The standard procedure for detecting a pathogen causing an infectious disease
is to grow it in the laboratory from a suitable clinical specimen (such as sputum
or blood). However, many viruses, and some bacteria, are difficult or even
impossible to grow in the laboratory. In these cases, molecular methods ±
especially PCR ± provide an important tool for the laboratory diagnosis of
infection, and are now in common use in clinical virology laboratories.
In addition, PCR tests and gene probes are both available for the identification and speciation of pathogens that have been cultured. Molecular techniques such as RFLP analysis (see Chapter 12) are widely used for the
differentiation of bacterial strains (typing or fingerprinting) for epidemiological
purposes. For example, the standard method for typing strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacterium that causes tuberculosis (TB), is shown in
Figure 16.4. Each track shows a different isolate of M. tuberculosis. Total
DNA preparations were cut with PvuII and electrophoresed through an agarose gel. Following Southern blotting, the membrane was hybridized with a
labelled probe derived from the insertion sequence IS6110. If two patients have
caught TB from the same source, the IS6110 patterns will be identical (see the
arrowed tracks in Figure 16.4). If they are different, we can conclude that they
are not part of the same outbreak.

MEDICAL APPLICATIONS, PRESENT AND FUTURE

16.3 Human Genetic Diseases
16.3.1 Identifying disease genes
One of the most important applications of gene technology lies in the ability to
detect genetic mutations that result in specific diseases, or in a predisposition to
the development of such a disease. We have already discussed various methods
employed for identifying mutations that cause disease (or other distinguishing
traits) in different chapters of this book. Here, we will take the opportunity to
look back at the general strategy and integrate the different parts we have
touched upon earlier.
The classical approach towards identifying a disease gene is based on
the concept of linkage analysis, as described in Chapter 14, which enables the
position of genetic markers to be mapped to specific regions of one of
the chromosomes. Before the advent of molecular methods, the construction
of a genetic map in model organisms (especially Drosophila and mice) was
carried out by painstaking hard work, involving large numbers of controlled
crosses between strains with different genetic markers. The extent to which two
different genetic markers are inherited together (co-segregate), or in other
words the degree of linkage between the markers, provides an estimate of
their relative position. Genes that are close to one another will tend to be
inherited together. In this way, a genetic map (or linkage map) can be gradually
built up, showing the relative position of the available genetic markers. The
position of specific disease-associated genes can be located by the degree of
linkage to other markers. Of course, linkage analysis in humans is much more
difficult, as controlled crossing is not an option.
In some cases, it is possible to supplement the linkage analysis, with another
form of mapping, known as cytogenetic mapping. Staining of eukaryotic
chromosomes with a dye such as Giemsa stain produces a characteristic
banding pattern, as some parts of the chromosome take up the stain much
more heavily than others (see Figure 16.5). If the mutation causes a change in
the banding pattern, then its position can be detected microscopically. This is
especially useful in organisms such as Drosophila, where the salivary gland cells
contain bundles of sister chromatids lying side by side. This polytene structure
makes the banding pattern much more obvious. However, cytogenetic mapping is also useful in other organisms, as an initial stage in gene mapping; for
example, the human gene coding for the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase
(which is defective in people with phenylketonuria) can be located to the band
designated 12q24 on the long arm of chromosome 12. However, this is a
relatively imprecise method of mapping, with a resolution of several million
base pairs. If the gene concerned has already been cloned, in situ hybridization
can be used to determine its position on the chromosome more precisely. This

Figure 16.5 Chromosome banding patterns: this shows a simplified representation of
the banding pattern of human chromosome 12

usually involves fluorescently-labelled probes, and hence is known as fluorescent in situ hybridization or FISH.
One limitation of genetic linkage analysis is the need for markers that have
an identifiable phenotype. Since there is a limited number of such markers,
even in well-studied organisms, the linkage map will be relatively crude. However, we can use molecular markers, such as RFLPs and microsatellites (see
Chapter 12), to locate a disease-associated gene more precisely, by mapping its
linkage to a specific polymorphism. This approach can be applied to human
genetics by examining very large pedigrees from which DNA samples are
available, rather than by making controlled crosses.
These forms of gene mapping simply show you the chromosomal location of
a gene that determines susceptibility to a specific disease (or some other trait).
They do not identify the gene, its product, or its function. However, they do
provide a route for cloning such a gene. It is important to realize that we may
not have any information about the function of this gene, beyond knowing that
there is a gene in which mutations result in a certain disease, so none of the
approaches outlined in Chapter 8 for identifying a gene in a library is available
to us. However, if we have mapped its position well enough, so that we know it
is close to a defined marker (whether this is another gene, a polymorphism or a
microsatellite), then we can use a probe for that locus to screen a large insert
gene library (using for example YAC vectors) to obtain a clone that carries the
defined marker and a substantial amount of adjacent DNA, which we hope
contains the disease gene. Since this form of cloning relies solely on the position
of the gene, it is known as positional cloning (Figure 16.6).
The distance that can be covered by this approach can be extended by
chromosome walking (see Chapter 14). In this technique, the first clone, carrying

the known marker, is used to probe the gene library again, so as to identify
clones carrying adjacent sequences; these are in turn used as probes to obtain
the next region of the chromosome, and so on. When your `walk' reaches the
region where you expect the gene to be, analysis of the sequence by the methods
described in Chapter 11 will enable the identification of genes and their
putative products. This will lead to a candidate gene that may be responsible
for the disease in question, and the structure of this gene can be tested in
individuals with and without the disease to confirm the association.
The processes of positional cloning and chromosome walking are simpler to
describe than to carry out. However, the availability of the sequence of the
human genome, and of genomes of other organisms, makes it a lot simpler. It is
now possible to screen putative genes in the area of interest in a matter of hours
on a computer, rather than in months or years in a laboratory.
An alternative approach is to base the search on gene products (mRNA or
proteins) rather than on the DNA itself. This is based on the assumption that
expression of the relevant gene will be altered in the diseased state, or that the
structure of the product will be different. Both of these assumptions can be
used ± either separately or in combination ± to devise protocols for the
identification of candidate genes. The most important of these protocols was
described in Chapter 13.
The final identification of the relevant gene will usually rely on a combination of techniques. The putative genes identified by positional cloning and
chromosome walking can be tested for their association with the disease state
by specifically testing the expression of those genes in the diseased tissue, or by
analysing the structure of the protein. In experimental animals, final confirmation will come from a combination of gene knockout and complementation
experiments (Chapter 17).
The power of these techniques therefore relies on a combination of approaches. Classical genetics (often termed forward genetics) starts with a

16.3

HUMAN GENETIC DISEASES

319

phenotype (whether a diseased state or yellow peas) and works towards an
identification of the genes responsible. On the other hand, the molecular
approach offers the possibility of starting with differences in a defined DNA
sequence, and investigating the phenotypic effects of such a change. This is
often called reverse genetics.
Sometimes one or more candidates are obvious without any further experiments being necessary. For example, no reverse genetics was needed to conclude that mutations in the red and green cone photopigment genes were
candidates for the cause of red/green colour blindness. Nor was any forward
genetic analysis needed ± the linkage of these conditions to the X chromosome
is well established from observations of their pattern of inheritance. Thus, the
mapping of these two a priori candidate genes to the X chromosome constituted strong supporting evidence for the initial hypothesis. In this way, forward
and reverse genetics interact ± the chromosomal location and the expression
pattern are both important parts of the jigsaw puzzle.
The central piece of evidence, however, is quite naturally the sequencing of
the allele from affected individuals and the confirmation that it is different
from the wild type. This is not, however, sufficient on its own. The mutation
must first be analysed, using methods that we have described in Chapter 11.
First of all, is it located where it could be predicted to have a biological effect?
This would often involve the alteration of the encoded amino acid sequence in a
subtle or more drastic way. However, even if the coding region is completely
unaltered from the wild type, mutations in the promoter region that affect the
expression of the gene, mutations in splice sites or insertions that otherwise
affect mRNA processing could still cause disease. However, even if you did
show the cause to be one of these, the scientific community would normally
demand even more evidence before your discovery could be published. Some
polymorphisms, such as amino acid substitutions, occur completely normally
in the population without causing any abnormality. One way to show that the
mutation causes disease is to express the mutated protein and compare its
biological properties to its wild-type counterpart. Another way, preferably
used in combination, is of course to show that the mutation that you have
discovered co-segregates with the disease to a significant degree in a genetic
pedigree.

16.3.2 Genetic diagnosis
The identification of mutations that give rise to human genetic diseases not
only leads to significant insights into the nature of those diseases but also
provides a mechanism for molecular diagnosis. This is of particular benefit in
prenatal diagnosis, which involves obtaining samples containing foetal cells by
amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling ± the latter technique having the

320

MEDICAL APPLICATIONS, PRESENT AND FUTURE

advantage of being able to be carried out at an earlier stage of pregnancy,
which is important if abortion is considered as an option. The gene(s) to be
tested can be amplified by PCR and specific point mutations detected by the
use of a pair of labelled oligonucleotides, one of which will hybridize to the
normal sequence and the other being specific for the mutant (see Chapter 12).
Alternatively, real-time PCR procedures (see Chapter 13) can be devised that
will differentiate the two versions of the sequence directly, producing much
quicker results.
A further advantage of molecular techniques for detecting mutations is the
ability to detect the presence of the defective gene in heterozygous carriers. If
the mutation is recessive, the heterozygotes will show no symptoms of the
condition, but a proportion of the offspring of two heterozygous parents will
have the disease. In the past, genetic counselling of prospective parents from
families with a history of a genetic disease has relied on statistical probabilities
to assess the likelihood that both parents carry the affected gene. With molecular techniques, it is possible to be certain, one way or the other.
Similar considerations apply to genes which only show their effects later in
life, and to those genes that only cause a predisposition to a specific disease.
For example, in some families there is a particularly high incidence of breast
cancer, indicating an inherited predisposition to this disease. In many cases this
has been traced to a specific gene, BRCA1. Individuals carrying a mutated gene
have a higher risk of developing breast cancer, although the presence of the
affected gene does not mean that it is certain that they will develop the disease.
There are substantial ethical issues raised by the availability of these techniques. Even if one accepts abortion as an option under some circumstances, its
use as a method to prevent the birth of a `defective' child raises the uncomfortable spectre of eugenics. This is more of a concern for the future, whereas the
ability to test people for the presence of genes that may affect their subsequent
health or lifespan already has serious implications for their ability to obtain life
or medical insurance, subject to legal restrictions that may limit the powers of
insurers in this respect.

16.3.3 Gene therapy
Knowing which mutation, in which gene, causes a disease is not a prerequisite
for treating it. Many genetic diseases have been successfully treated for decades
or even centuries thanks to insights in the pathophysiology of the conditions,
or indeed because of the discovery of treatments by trial and error or even sheer
coincidence. Nonetheless, although it is neither the beginning nor the end,
discovering the exact genetic nature of a condition is a very important step.
First, as described above, it makes it possible to devise precise diagnostic

16.3

HUMAN GENETIC DISEASES

321

methods to confirm who has, or is predisposed to, a specific condition. It may
then be possible to alleviate and sometimes even prevent the disease. Second,
knowing the primary structure of the mutated gene enables us to make predictions of the impact of the mutation with the help of computer programs
(Chapter 11). It also allows us to express the resulting protein (if any) and
characterize it in the laboratory (Chapter 13). Furthermore, it puts us in the
position of being able to produce a mouse engineered to carry the same
mutation, so that we have an animal model that closely approximates the
human condition we wish to study (Chapter 17). All of this will be of great
help in the development of improved treatments for the condition. However,
there will probably always be conditions where treatment is not enough to
alleviate the symptoms. This is the rationale for developing treatments involving gene transfer (gene therapy).
Gene therapy treatments could potentially take place by targeting the specifically diseased organs in an affected individual (somatic gene therapy), or by
correcting the gene defect in gametes or fertilised eggs (germline gene therapy).
There are strong reasons why most gene therapy research focuses on the
former. First, the genetic manipulation of embryos is inherently a very contentious issue, and the controversy is exacerbated by the fact that germline therapy
would lead to an inheritable alteration in the genetic material. Even the
prenatal diagnosis and specific abortion of diseased embryos, which a significant percentage of the population would object to, has a far greater acceptance
in society as a whole.
Second, there is an obvious need to treat people who are alive and suffering
now, and indeed there will always be people born suffering from genetic
disease. However, somatic gene therapy would only lead to a cure for that
patient, and would not remove the underlying genetic cause ± so there would
still be the risk of the individual concerned passing the defective gene on to his
or her offspring.

Viral vectors for gene therapy
The principle of delivering genes to the cells of a human being is not different
from that of delivering genes to any other cells. Gene expression can be either
transient or permanent. Delivery can be either directly into the affected tissues ±
in vivo ± or into cells transiently removed from the patient's body ± ex vivo. For
ex vivo delivery, the methodology is virtually the same as for transfecting
mammalian cell lines in culture ± genes can be delivered using liposomes,
calcium phosphate precipitation, or electroporation. However, the methodology that is attracting the greatest interest by far, both for the development of
in vivo and ex vivo methods, is the use of viral vectors.

322

MEDICAL APPLICATIONS, PRESENT AND FUTURE

Amongst these are the adenoviruses. These are common causes of respiratory
tract infections, especially pharyngitis (sore throat), but it is possible to produce defective viruses that do not cause disease, and to replace the deleted
regions with a cloned gene. The recombinant DNA will persist for some time
within the infected cell, but not indefinitely. This limitation has both advantages and disadvantages. The advantage is the fact that any negative effects are
likely to be reversible. The disadvantage is that re-infection is needed to sustain
the effect. Nonetheless, trials with adenovirus vectors are already in progress.
One case where they are particularly promising is in the therapy of cystic
fibrosis, a recessive disorder caused by a mutation in a chloride transporter,
which manifests itself most strongly in respiratory problems. Naturally, a viral
vector based on a respiratory virus is potentially a very promising vehicle for
reintroducing the correct form of the gene into these tissues.
Another DNA virus that can be used for gene therapy is herpes simplex virus
I (HSV-I). Unlike adenovirus infections, HSV-I infections persist throughout
the lifetime of the patient, although they remain latent through most of it. The
preference of this virus for a particular cell type ± nerve cells ± makes it
especially interesting for correcting mutations affecting these cells.
Retroviruses are the natural choice of vector for stable expression. The
biology of these viruses, and their use as cloning vectors, was described in
Chapter 6. The main feature that is important here is that after infection the
RNA genome of the virus is copied into DNA by reverse transcriptase and
integrated efficiently into the host genome. By replacing the genes needed to
form new viral particles, two birds are killed with one stone ± space is created
for the introduction of the gene that is to be transferred, and the recombinant
virus is prevented from re-infecting other cells.
Integration into the host genome is an effective way of ensuring reliable and
lasting expression, that is also transferred to the progeny of the infected cell,
and we shall therefore encounter retroviruses once again in the following
chapter as a vector for the production of germline transgenics. Disadvantages
include the limited space available for the gene that is to be inserted, and the
fact that retroviruses are not very efficient in cells that do not divide, such as
nerve cells. In addition, we have to remember that this class of viruses includes
some notable pathogens, not only HIV but also other viruses that cause some
forms of cancer in humans and animals. Although the vectors described are
defective, their widespread use for gene therapy would require extensive checks
to ensure that untoward effects do not occur by interaction with other naturally occurring retroviruses.
The potential of gene therapy is not limited to inherited diseases. In particular, there is considerable potential for novel cancer treatments by suppressing
the activity of oncogenes, for example by using antisense technology (see
Chapter 17), or by targeting toxic genes to cancerous tissue. The serious nature
of these diseases provides a powerful argument for employing an approach that

16.3

HUMAN GENETIC DISEASES

323

has such potential, but there are concerns. Partly these rest on a sort of feeling
that altering DNA in this way is somehow unnatural. On the other hand, there
is a feeling that in some way we are in danger of letting the genie out of the
bottle. Could the techniques developed for the praiseworthy objective of
eliminating the suffering caused by diseases such as cystic fibrosis be exploited
for other ends? These are serious questions that demand a wider rational
debate, and scientists have a role in trying to ensure that a wider audience is
sufficiently educated about the issues to achieve this level of rationality.

17 Transgenics
17.1 Transgenesis and Cloning
Much of this book deals with the genetic manipulation of individual cells in
culture, by introducing genes from other sources or in other ways specifically
altering the genetic composition of those cells. A major aspect of this is the
expression of a gene from one source in cells of a different type, in culture. In this
chapter, we will deal with the stable introduction of a gene into another
organism, which is referred to as transgenics. For a bacterial geneticist, there is
no distinction between manipulating individual cells and manipulating an
organism. In effect, all the previous discussion of genetic modification of
bacteria (and of unicellular eukaryotes such as Saccharomyces) could be
labelled as transgenics. On the other hand, for somebody who works with
truly multicellular organisms, such as plants or animals, the distinction between
manipulating a cell line in culture and genetic modification of a whole plant or
animal is very real and important. A gene can be stably transfected into a cell
line quite cheaply, and this can be used to provide fast and reasonably useful
answers to many questions ± but is inevitably limited in scope. In particular, it
cannot provide definitive answers to questions about the differentiation of cells
in the normal animal, nor about the interaction between different cells. The
creation of a genetically manipulated whole organism is much more difficult
and much more expensive, but often much more informative. Systems such as
Drosophila (Chapter 14), and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, provide a
useful compromise, in that they are reasonably easy to work with but at the
same time are capable of addressing some of these difficult questions ± assuming
that the lessons learned from fruit flies are also applicable to higher animals.
More controversially than these research-oriented applications, a transgenic
organism may be created not to answer a question, but for a specific, usually
commercial, purpose. We will discuss both of these uses in some detail later.
It is important to distinguish the production of transgenic plants and
animals from cloning of the plants or animals themselves. The former involves
the introduction of foreign DNA, in the form of cloned genes. In contrast, the
latter means obtaining progeny that are genetically identical to the original
plant or animal, which includes methods ranging from the widely publicized

326

TRANSGENICS

procedure that led to the birth of Dolly the sheep to techniques for asexual
propagation of plants (such as taking cuttings) that have been in use for
hundreds of years.
When you introduce a transgene into an organism, you insert into the
genome a foreign gene, be it from the same species or from a different one.
Owing to the virtual universality of the coding properties of DNA, huge
evolutionary distances can be bridged in transgenesis ± the example of a fish
gene inserted into tomato plants for cold hardiness achieved notoriety. In order
to be of any use in a multicellular organism, the transgene must be inserted into
germline DNA, so that it can be propagated in subsequent generations. Other
applications where genes are inserted into somatic cells (cells that are not
involved in reproduction of the organism), for example for gene therapy,
were considered in Chapter 16.
In principle, the technology is available to insert transgenes into any species
(the first transgenic monkey was recently created). In some species, it is also
technically possible to do what is conceptually the opposite ± to knock out a gene
(which may involve disrupting the gene rather than deleting it entirely). The use
of gene knock-outs in bacteria was considered in Chapter 14; as we will see later
on, obtaining gene knock-outs in whole animals follows a similar procedure.

17.2 Animal Transgenesis and its Applications
In order to ensure expression of the transgene in the entire animal, the transgenic construct must first be introduced into the germline. The techniques for
doing this are most advanced, and most commonly used, in mice. The most
obvious, and most common, method is to physically inject the transgenic
construct into the nucleus of a fertilized egg, which is then cultured in vitro
for several cell generations before being implanted in a foster mother (Figure
17.1). This is conceptually simple, but by no means a trivial affair. Not all eggs
survive the injection without damage, not all of them will develop, and not all
of them will contain the transgene. Only a proportion of the resulting embryos
will be transgenic, so it is necessary to screen the embryos (using gene probes
and/or PCR) for the presence of the foreign gene. The result for each embryo is
all or nothing ± if the gene is present in one cell it is usually present in all cells.
Mosaics (animals in which the gene is present in some cells or tissues and not in
others, also known as chimaeras) do not usually occur with this procedure
(although mosaics are sometimes created intentionally in other ways) and so
the transgene will be present in the germline cells and transmitted to the
progeny. The chromosomal location of the integrated DNA differs from one
animal to another, as does the number of copies of the integrated DNA, which
may range from a single copy to several hundred. The level of expression of the
inserted gene may therefore vary from one animal to another.

Two methods of producing transgenic mice

One alternative method is to use retroviral vectors, as described in Chapter 6.
Technically, this is much simpler. The fertilized egg can be allowed to develop
to the eight-cell stage before infecting it with the (defective) recombinant virus
(Figure 17.1). This method has distinct limitations, however. First, these
vectors can only accommodate approximately 8 kb of DNA, which may not
be sufficient for the whole coding region and the necessary promoter elements
(see below). Second, the modified retrovirus does not contain the genes necessary for replication as a virus. It needs assistance from a helper virus to be
infective. This helper virus could lodge itself into the genome as well and, like a
prophage, become infective again at some stage in the future. If the helper virus
is also present in the embryo, it can result in the unwanted spread of the
recombinant construct to other animals. The method described in Chapter 6
uses helper cells as an intermediate stage, to produce infective virus particles
that do not need a helper virus, and thus circumvents this problem. However,

328

TRANSGENICS

there is still the possibility that a subsequent retrovirus infection of the transgenic animals might result in mobilization of the recombinant DNA. A further
limitation is that, although infection of eight-cell embryos is technically simpler
than micro-injection, the fact that cell division has occurred before infection
takes place means that there is a possibility that not all the cells in the embryo
will be infected. Mosaicism (see above) is therefore a potential problem, but
non-chimaeric animals, containing the cloned gene in all their cells, can be
obtained by allowing the animals to reproduce and selecting the progeny that
carry the gene concerned. Retroviruses are thus limited in their application for
transgenic animals, but do play a significant role in the development of potential techniques for gene therapy (see Chapter 16).
A third method is the transfection of embryonic stem cells, and their subsequent incorporation into mouse embryos. This method allows selection and
enrichment of transgenic cells, which permits an even richer range of potential
manipulations. These are discussed in a separate section below.

17.2.1 Expression of transgenes
Even when successfully integrated in the genome, the positioning of the transgene is more or less completely random. The objective is obviously that the
gene lodges itself into a region where it does not disrupt another gene. Because
most of the DNA in plants and animals does not actually form part of a gene,
the odds are actually stacked against any such problems occurring. Nonetheless, occasionally they do. In some instances, this is lethal. In others, there is an
obvious risk that the disruption of a different gene creates a phenotype which
has nothing to do with the transgene itself.
The random localization of the transgene will also affect its level of expression. This is because there are large-scale regional differences on the chromosomes ± the environment surrounding the transgene may not be conducive to
its expression.
We also need to consider the regulation of the expression of the inserted
transgene. In Chapter 15, we discussed the expression of cloned genes in
mammalian cells in culture. In that context, the emphasis was on promoters
that were constitutively active, or could be turned on and off by altering the
culture conditions. Neither approach is really suitable for a transgenic animal,
where we would normally want to target gene expression to specific tissues.
For some purposes, the ideal objective would be to introduce the native
transcription unit into a genotype that lacks it. This would require a cloned
sequence covering the whole gene and its associated regulators, including
activator sequences and promoter elements as well as the introns and exons.
The conceptually simplest, and often preferable, method of constructing such a
transgene exploits the large coding capacity of yeast artificial chromosome

17.2

ANIMAL TRANSGENESIS AND ITS APPLICATIONS

329

(YAC) vectors, as described in Chapter 6. Such an approach was not available
when these methods were first used, but now constitutes an attractive option in
this situation.
One alternative is to mix and match promoter and coding sequences. The
closest to a YAC transgene would be to combine a genomic clone of
the promoter region of the native gene with a cDNA clone of the same gene.
The absence of introns may have some effect, but they are certainly not in any
way necessary for mammalian gene expression ± some mammalian genes do
not have them in the first place. What may make more of a difference, however,
is the promoter. You would certainly have pinpointed it using reporter gene
constructs before spending a minor fortune on producing a transgenic organism. However, the conditions in the cell line where this was done do not
necessarily apply to the conditions in the native cells. Moreover, there may
be important elements ± positive or negative ± that are located some considerable distance away from the transcription start site.
Apart from combining a cDNA with its own promoter, there are many
inventive and informative combinations that can be ± and have been ± made,
either to obtain tissue-specific expression of the transgene or to identify the
tissues or cell types in which that gene would naturally be expressed. Many of
these examples are related to topics that have been discussed in earlier chapters
in relation to the manipulation of unicellular microorganisms or of cell lines in
culture. Here are a few examples.
(1) If the promoter region of the gene you want has not been characterized, a
cDNA copy of your gene may be combined with a different promoter that has
the same cell or tissue specificity.
(2) In order to investigate the exact cell/tissue specificity of a promoter, or its
activity under different conditions, it may be combined with a reporter gene
such as lacZ (which is easy to detect histologically) or luciferase (which is easy
to detect in vivo). Similar applications of reporter genes for individual cells in
culture were described in Chapter 13.
(3) A promoter may be combined with a gene, such as the gene for the A
subunit of diphtheria toxin (DTA) which will specifically damage any cell type
in which it is expressed. (The inserted gene does not include that part of the
toxin, the B subunit, that is needed for cell entry, so it will only affect the cells in
which it is expressed.)

recessive mutated phenotype by introducing the wild-type gene, which will
provide conclusive proof of the identity of the gene. This can obviously be

accomplished with a YAC clone as well (see also the discussion of complementation in Chapter 14).
(5) Alternatively, you may produce a construct that removes functionality
from the cell where the promoter is expressed. This may be done in a number of
ways. You may place the cDNA in the reversed direction, so that it produces an
antisense mRNA, which will bind to the native species and reduce its translation (Figure 17.2). The reasons for this effect are not fully understood, but it is
thought that either ribosomes are unable to bind to the hybrid RNA, or that
the double-stranded RNA is degraded by ribonucleases. We will consider an
application of this approach in the section on transgenic plants, later in this
chapter.

17.2.2 Embryonic stem-cell technology
This technology, currently only available in mice, is based not on the manipulation of individual fertilized eggs or embryos, but on cells that can be grown
in culture. Some types of cells taken from an adult animal can be grown in
culture, for a short time. In some cases, these can give rise to established cell lines
which can be maintained indefinitely through serial subculture. Manipulation
of animal cells in culture (as considered in previous chapters) is considerably
easier than introducing genes into a fertilized egg. However, the differentiation
of such cells is not usually reversible; they cannot be used to produce a whole
animal. This is a marked contrast to the situation in many plants, where cells
from various parts of the plant, although differentiated, are still capable of
producing whole plants; such cells are said to be totipotent. This is why it is so

17.2

ANIMAL TRANSGENESIS AND ITS APPLICATIONS

331

easy to propagate many plants asexually, e.g. by taking cuttings, or even by
starting from in vitro cell cultures. It is also why there was so much excitement
over Dolly the sheep, which was a demonstration that it is actually possible,
through some intricate techniques, to reverse the differentiation of some cells
from an adult animal.
Obviously, cells at an early stage in the development of an embryo still have the
potential to develop into many types of cell in the adult mouse; these are known
as embryonic stem cells (ES cells). If cells are collected at the blastocyst stage, they
can be grown in culture for a limited period of time; if established ES cell lines are
used it is not necessary to harvest cells from embryos. The availability of cells in
culture, whether they are fresh ES cells or a cell line, means that many of the
techniques described in earlier chapters can be employed ± in particular, the
investigator can include selectable markers in the construct. These convey resistance to toxic compounds that are then added to the growth medium. This is
similar to antibiotic selection for plasmids in bacteria: only cells that have
successfully integrated the transgene will survive. These selected cells are then
injected into blastocysts and implanted into a surrogate mother (Figure 17.3).

TRANSGENICS

The progeny will be chimaeric, since the blastocyst will still contain some of
the non-manipulated cells, and heterozygous, since normally only one of the
chromosomes will be altered. Subsequent breeding and selection of the progeny
will give rise to stable homozygous mutant mice.
A further advantage of ES technology is that it allows the introduction of
the construct in an exactly specified site in the host genome. This is done by
including two sequences that are identical to two particular adjacent regions in
a host chromosome. Just as in normal meiosis, recombination at these sites
will occur with a certain frequency, leading to the specific insertion of the
transgene exactly in the desired place ± a process known as homologous recombination (Figure 17.4). The insert gene would normally be accompanied by a
selectable marker gene, so that we can select the cells in which the insert
has become integrated into the chromosome. However, it has to be remembered that in animal cells random integration of transfecting DNA occurs quite
frequently, so it may be necessary to screen a number of clones in order to
find one that has the insert at the right place. This can be made easier
by including a second marker gene on the construct, outside the region flanked
by the homologous sequences. Random integration of the transfecting
DNA would lead to integration of the whole construct, while integration
by homologous recombination will only insert the region between the
two recombination sites (see Figure 17.4). The cells we are looking for will
therefore lack the second marker from the construct, and can thus be easily
identified.

17.2.3 Gene knock-outs
ES cell technology with homologous recombination also makes it possible to
not only add a gene, but also to remove (or modify) an existing one. In the above
description of introducing a transgene into a specific site, our choice of homologous sequences would be designed so that integration will take place in a
part of the genome that allows the gene to be freely expressed without disrupting any other genes. However, disrupting the gene may be exactly what we
want to do, and we can achieve it in a very specific way. A transgenic construct
is produced that contains resistance markers, and a part of the gene we wish to
manipulate with a specific manipulation made. This could be the disruption of
the promoter, the introduction of a stop codon early on in the coding region, or
the deletion of part of the gene. In the version shown in Figure 17.5, the target
gene is disrupted by the incorporation of a neo gene. (This gene gets its name
because it makes bacteria resistant to neomycin, but in animal cells another
aminoglycoside antibiotic, known as G418 or Geneticin, is used.) The resulting
offspring will therefore not express the target gene ± we have created a knockout mouse. This procedure is basically the same as that described in Chapter 14
for allelic replacement in bacteria. Knock-out mice have been absolutely
crucial in elucidating the exact function of many genes. The method is not
without its pitfalls, however. The absence of the gene may be lethal to the
embryo. Alternatively, overexpression of other genes may compensate for the
absence of the knocked-out gene, thus obscuring the phenotype.

TRANSGENICS

As an alternative strategy, we can employ antisense technology, in which
expression of the reverse complement of the mRNA interferes with normal
translation. This usually reduces, rather than eliminates, the synthesis of the
relevant protein, and has a potential role in gene therapy (see Chapter 16).
From this description of the procedures that can be used, it should be clear
that transgenic technology is extremely valuable for research into the role and
regulation of specific gene products in the development and characteristics of a
variety of animals, including predominantly mice, rats, Xenopus, and zebrafish.
We now want to turn to the practical applications, real and potential, of these
techniques.

17.2.4 Gene knock-in technology
Most diseases are not caused by the complete disruption of gene function, but
by mutations that alter it only in part. This is not only because a smaller
mutation is statistically more likely to happen than a bigger one, but also
because its effects are more likely to be subtle and less likely to be lethal.
Such mutations can be introduced by knock-in technology, where one or
more exons are replaced with an altered one. Indeed, producing animal models
of disease is not the only important application of this technology, or even
necessarily the most important one. The concept is important in any situation
where we do not want to lose a gene completely, so knock-out technology is not
appropriate, but rather we want to introduce specific changes into that gene.
One important example of the application of knock-in technology is the
production of mouse strains in which critical portions of significant genes
have been replaced with, or engineered to be more similar to, their human
equivalents. The potential value of such strains, for example in the testing of
the toxicity and/or action of new drugs, is obvious.
The procedure for producing knock-in mice is very similar to that described
above for gene knock-outs, or to the procedure in Chapter 14 for allelic
replacement in bacteria. The desirable mutation(s) is introduced into
the exon(s) in question, using site-directed mutagenesis or other procedures
described in Chapter 15, and a selectable marker such as the neo gene (see
above) is inserted into an intervening intron. Homologous recombination will
then result in the replacement of the chromosomal gene with the modified
sequence.

17.2.5 Applications of transgenic animals
Another application that is at least as controversial as gene therapy is the use of
transgenic technology for commercially important animals such as cattle and

17.3 TRANSGENIC PLANTS AND THEIR APPLICATIONS

335

sheep. This should be put in perspective. Conventional properties of farm
animals, such as their rate of growth or milk production, have been manipulated by selected breeding for thousands of years, resulting in the specialized
breeds that we see today that bear little resemblance to their original ancestors.
Against this background, the novel aspect of transgenic technology is the
ability to introduce additional genes, from other sources. This means that the
animals can be used as a source of a variety of useful products.
One approach that is being studied in particular involves attaching the
foreign genes to a promoter that will be active in mammary tissue, such as
the casein or beta-lactoglobulin promoters. Consequently, the protein concerned will be produced in large quantities in milk. This opens the field not
only for enriching the milk itself with various proteins, but also for the use of
cattle or sheep as bioreactors for producing great amounts of proteins with
various uses. The production of pharmaceutically useful proteins by farm
animals has been termed `pharming'. This can offer substantial advantages
over the use of recombinant bacterial cultures. In the first place, it avoids the
need to build and run expensive industrial-scale fermenters. In addition, using
animal hosts means that the product is likely to have the appropriate posttranslational modifications, which is often not the case for products obtained
from bacteria.
Recombinant plants also offer considerable potential in this way, as described in the following section.

17.3 Transgenic Plants and their Applications
Producing transgenic plants is a much simpler affair, as plant cells, unlike
animal cells, are pluripotent. In many cases, plant cells can be grown in culture,
and manipulated, and whole plants regenerated from these individual cells ±
although this is not as easy for monocotyledons (cereals and grasses), which is
unfortunate as this includes many of the major food crops. There is a variety of
ways of introducing DNA into plant cells, including protoplast transformation/electroporation, microinjection, biolistics, and transfer from Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
For protoplast transformation, the plant cell wall is digested with suitable
enzymes to obtain protoplasts. These will take up DNA quite readily, and the
efficiency can be improved by the use of electroporation (see Chapter 6), or by
fusion with DNA-containing liposomes. Microinjection involves the direct
injection of DNA into the nucleus of the plant cell, in much the same way as
was described above for animal cells.
Biolistics involves coating tiny beads of gold with DNA and bombarding the
plant cells at high velocity; this technique has also been used with other types of
cell (see also the discussion of DNA vaccines in Chapter 16). For plants it has

336

TRANSGENICS

the advantage of being also applicable to embryonic plants, and so avoids the
difficulty of regenerating some types of plants from individual cells.
Each of the above methods has been encountered elsewhere in this book, in
relation to different types of cells. The most distinct way of getting foreign
DNA into a plant cell involves the bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens. In
nature, this causes a type of plant tumour known as a crown gall. The pathogenic ability of these bacteria is associated with the presence of a type of
plasmid, known as a tumour-inducing (Ti) plasmid. The tumour is produced
by the transfer of plasmid DNA (or more specifically a 23 kb fragment of the
plasmid, known as T-DNA) from the bacterium to the plant cells, where it
becomes integrated into the plant chromosomal DNA. This can be exploited
by hooking foreign genes up to the plasmid in such a way that the genes
concerned are also transferred into the plant cells.
This is actually more difficult than it sounds. The natural Ti plasmids are
very large (over 200 kb), and so it is not possible to clone genes directly into
them. One strategy for overcoming this is illustrated in Figure 17.6 . In this
procedure, the initial construct in E. coli is made in an intermediate vector,
which is a small plasmid containing a part of the T-DNA fragment from a Ti
plasmid. The recombinant intermediate vector can be transferred to A. tumefaciens by conjugation. Within the A. tumefaciens cell, a single recombination
event between the homologous T-DNA sequences on the intermediate vector

337

and the resident Ti plasmid will result in the incorporation of the entire intermediate vector plasmid into the T-DNA region of the Ti plasmid. The intermediate plasmid is not able to replicate in A. tumefaciens, so selection for antibiotic
resistance will enable recovery of the bacterial cells carrying the co-integrate
plasmid. Infection of a plant will now result in the transmission of the genes from
the intermediate vector (including the cloned insert) into the plant cells along
with the T-DNA.
Rather than infecting an intact plant, A. tumefaciens can be used to infect
plant cells in culture and transformants can be isolated on a selective medium.
All cells in a plant regenerated from a transformed cell will contain the cloned
gene, and so the gene will be inherited in the subsequent progeny of that plant.
However, plant cells infected with a wild-type Ti plasmid will not regenerate
properly, because of the oncogenic effects of the T-DNA; but only short
sequences at the ends of the T-DNA region are necessary for transmission to
the plant cells. The oncogenic genes between these sequences can be removed,
resulting in disarmed Ti plasmids. Any DNA that is inserted between these two
sequences, in place of the normal oncogenic genes, will be transmitted to the
plant cells and, in the absence of the oncogenes, the plant cells can be regenerated into mature plants carrying the foreign DNA.
Just as in animal transgenesis, a suitable combination of promoter and gene
is chosen to express the gene in the desired location and quantity. One promoter that is used for this purpose is derived from the cauliflower mosaic virus.
Clearly, producing genetically modified (GM) plants is much simpler than GM
animals and, unsurprisingly, the commercial exploitation of this fact has gone
much further, and is already a reality.
One of the applications that has received a lot of publicity is the production
of plants that are resistant to insect attack. This most commonly involves the
insertion of a gene from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis coding for an
insecticidal toxin which is highly poisonous to certain groups of insects. Expression of this gene by a plant makes it resistant to insect attack, and thus
substantially reduces the need for spraying the crop with insecticides.
The second widely publicized application is that of resistance to herbicides
(principally glyphosate). This is often confused with insecticide resistance, but
the cases are quite different. Expression of a herbicide-resistance gene in a crop
plant enables the farmer to spray the crop with a broad-spectrum herbicide to
eliminate weeds.

17.3.1 Gene subtraction
In addition to adding genes to plants, it is possible to inactivate specific plant
genes. In general, this involves the use of anti-sense RNA (see Figure 17.1)
rather than gene knock-outs. The principle of antisense technology, as

338

TRANSGENICS

described earlier in this chapter, is that the production of the reverse complement of the mRNA interferes with the production of the corresponding protein.
One application of this is in delaying the ripening, and spoilage, of tomatoes.
In the later stages of ripening, an enzyme (polygalacturonase) is produced. This
enzyme breaks down polygalacturonic acid in the cell walls of the tomato and
thus softens the tomato. Softening is desirable, but if it goes too far, you get a
spoilt, squishy tomato. Introduction of part of the polygalacturonase gene,
under the control of a cauliflower mosaic virus vector but in the `wrong'
orientation, produces an antisense RNA which binds to the normal polygalacturonase mRNA and greatly reduces the enzyme levels in the fruit. Enough
enzyme is made to achieve a gradual softening, but the fruit can be stored for a
much longer period before it spoils.
There is an extremely wide variety of other modifications that have been
made, and the list will grow very rapidly. This includes genes that convey
tolerance to environmental factors such as cold or salt, or its texture, taste,
or colour (the latter important both in agricultural and horticultural crops); we
have mentioned previously the use of plants for the production of pharmaceutically important proteins. Of particular importance are modifications that
improve the nutritional content of the product. Many people in poorer countries rely extensively on a single food crop, such as rice, which often does not
provide an adequate level of all the essential nutrients and vitamins in their
diet.

17.4 Summary
In this chapter, as in the rest of the book, we have introduced the techniques
and some examples of their applications. Although this only scratches the
surface of a rapidly expanding subject, we hope it will have given you some
understanding of the underlying concepts involved, of the advances in knowledge that have already been attained, and of their future possibilities. Some of
these possibilities may be undesirable, but in many ways these techniques will
play a major role in improvements in health, to use just one example. From
your study of this book, you should be better placed to understand, and
hopefully contribute to, the debate over the use and control of genetic modification.
