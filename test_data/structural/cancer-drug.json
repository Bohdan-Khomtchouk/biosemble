Upon intratumoral administration, Ad-ISF135 preferentially transduces tumor cells and immunoregulatory cells in the tumor microenvironment. This increases the expression of CD154 in tumor cells, activates CD40 and stimulates signaling and immunoactivation, which are both mediated by CD40. This increases the expression of co-stimulatory molecules on these cells, which enhances their ability to function as antigen presenting cells (APCs) and increases their apoptotic potential. This leads to an increase in the infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils, which promote direct cytotoxicity, enhances the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the tumor microenvironment, and induces a specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response against the tumor cells. In addition, transduction with Ad-ISF35 induces direct tumor cell death, probably through an anti-viral immune response. Ad-ISF35 also exerts a strong bystander effect in non-transduced cells thereby further inducing tumor cell death. Altogether, this will eradicate tumor cells. CD154, the main ligand for CD40, plays a key role in the activation of APCs, promotes immunoactivation, and increases apoptotic potential. The protein encoded by Ad-ISF35 does not contain the mouse antibody binding domains and does not induce human neutralizing antibodies. The metalloprotease cleavage site is deleted in this chimeric CD154 and thus it resists cleavage; the encoded protein also contains amino acid substitutions within the carboxy-terminal.

Upon administration of gallium maltolate, Ga3+, which is structurally similar to the ferric ion (Fe3+), competes with and replaces Fe3+ in many vital Fe 3+-mediated biological reactions.. Unlike Fe3+, Ga3+ cannot be reduced, cannot participate in redox reactions and cannot mimic Fe3+ functions. In rapidly proliferating cells, such as cancer cells, high amounts of iron are needed for DNA synthesis. The incorporation of Ga3+ inactivates the Fe3+-dependent enzyme ribonucleotide reductase (RR), an enzyme essential for DNA synthesis, leading to an inhibition of DNA synthesis and induction of cell death in rapidly proliferating cells. Gallium similarly reduces bacterial cell growth. In addition, Ga3+ is able to suppress inflammation through the down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cells and the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. Gallium also exerts analgesic effects due to the inhibition of Fe3+-dependent enzymes involved in inflammation and may interfere with the activity of certain metalloproteinases and neuropeptides that are implicated in pain.

Upon oral administration of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, ombitasvir, enters the cell and binds to and blocks the activity of the NS5A protein. This results in the disruption of the viral RNA replication complex, blockage of HCV RNA production, and inhibition of viral replication. After intracellular uptake, paritaprevir reversibly binds to the active center and binding site of the HCV NS3/NS4A protease and prevents NS3/NS4A protease-mediated polyprotein maturation. This disrupts both the processing of viral proteins and the formation of the viral replication complex, which inhibits viral replication in HCV genotype 1-infected host cells. Although ritonavir is not active against HCV, it strongly inhibits the activity of CYP3A4, thereby blocking the degradation of paritaprevir, which is a CYP3A4 substrate. This leads to an increased concentration and half-life of paritaprevir as compared to the administration of paritaprevir without ritonavir. NS5A, a zinc-binding and proline-rich hydrophilic phosphoprotein, plays a crucial role in HCV RNA replication.
